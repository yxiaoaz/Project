Discussion and For the year ended (audited) (audited) Percentage of increase/ (decrease) Revenue (RMB million) (39.5%) Profit for the year (RMB million) (23.3%) Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (RMB million) (40.7%) Basic earnings per share (RMB cents) (40.9%) Diluted earnings per share (RMB cents) (30.7%) The audited consolidated revenue of the Group was approximately RMB3,792.6 million for 2014 (2013: approximately RMB6,269.1 million), representing a decrease of 39.5% as compared to 2013. The audited consolidated profit for the year and profit attributable to equity holders of the Company were approximately RMB1,056.2 million and RMB829.3 million respectively for 2014 (2013: approximately RMB1,376.3 million and RMB1,399.2 million respectively), representing a decline of 23.3% and 40.7% respectively as compared to the previous year. The basic and diluted earnings per share were RMB13.6 cents and RMB13.1 cents respectively for 2014 (2013: RMB23.0 cents and RMB18.9 cents respectively), representing a decrease of approximately 40.9% and 30.7% respectively as compared to 2013. The Board does not recommend payment of final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014. The overall property market plunged in the beginning of 2014, resulting in a downtrend in the first half of the year. Property prices fell, sales volume weakened, inventory level climbed and valuation was undermined in most cities. The lackluster condition weighed on market sentiment and imposed a downside risk on the industry. To turn the performance of the market around, the PRC Government launched various measures including the HPRs relaxation since June 2014, mortgage easing in September 2014 and different rate cuts by the PBOC in November 2014. Although HPRs remained in force in first-tier cities, there were more upgrade demand and demand in high quality properties, the elasticity of sales recovery would be more sensitive. Meanwhile, signs of healthier housing affordability in second- and third-tier cities caused by growth in disposable income have been identified, showing a positive prerequisite for a market turnaround. The favourable fiscal policy directed the market upward and created a more flexible macro-credit environment, providing more funding channels and relaxing onshore loan access. These aided developers in maintaining solid balance sheets, as well as narrowing any cash flow deficit during periods of slow turnover. Benefiting from the accommodative policies by the Government, pent-up demand started to release in the second half of 2014. However, the positive message took time to transit to the market and the overall impact from such catalyst was not completely reflected in the second half of 2014. It is expected that better conditions will be extended in 2015 and the overall market performance will improve steadily. Management The revenue of the Group was approximately RMB3,792.6 million for 2014 (2013: approximately RMB6,269.1 million), representing a decrease of 39.5% as compared to 2013. The reduced revenue was mainly due to the decrease in the GFA delivered from 787,024 sq.m. in 2013 to 420,664 sq.m. in 2014. The gross profit of the Group was approximately RMB985.9 million for 2014, representing a drop of 55.2% as compared to 2013 (2013: approximately RMB2,201.6 million). The reason for the decline was due to the decrease in revenue. The profit for the year of the Group has decreased by 23.3% from approximately RMB1,376.3 million in 2013 to approximately RMB1,056.2 million in 2014. The audited consolidated profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company has reduced from approximately RMB1,399.2 million in 2013 to approximately RMB829.3 million in 2014, representing a decrease of approximately RMB569.9 million or 40.7% from that of 2013. The major reason for the decrease was due to less GFA delivered in 2014 as compared to 2013. The cost of sales of the Group was RMB2,806.7 million for 2014, representing a decrease of approximately 31.0% as compared to 2013 (2013: approximately RMB4,067.5 million). Cost of sales decreased in line with revenue. The average cost of properties included in cost of sales of the Group was RMB4,925.7 per sq.m. for 2014, representing a slight increase of approximately 0.8% over 2013 (2013: average cost of properties included in cost of sales was RMB4,888.8 per sq.m.). The total GFA sold and delivered by the Group in 2014 was approximately 420,664 sq.m., representing a decrease of 46.6% as compared to 2013 (2013: approximately 787,024 sq.m.). Such decrease was due to less properties in Xiamen Mingfa Xiangwan Peninsula and Zhangzhou Mingfa Shopping Mall being delivered in 2014 as most of the properties had been delivered in 2013 upon full completion. During the year under review, the average sales price (the “ASP”) of the Group’s properties delivered and recognised as sales was RMB6,884.1 per sq.m., representing a decrease of 7.3% as compared to 2013 (2013: RMB7,425.0 per sq.m.). The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in ASP of residential properties of 5.1% in 2014. In the year under review, the Group recorded contracted sales of RMB1,889.7 million with GFA of 291,450 sq.m. (2013: approximately RMB6,320.0 million and 768,145 sq.m. respectively).

In the long run, the Group will continue to apply strategies in balanced property mix and geographical diversification in land bank to broaden income base and reduce risk efficiently. One of the Group’s core practices is to maintain no more than 50% of each property type in land bank. As at 31 December 2014, residential and commercial properties accounted for 48.0% and 28.3% of the Group’s total attributable GFA respectively. The steady rental contribution of approximately RMB279.1 million from investment properties has cushioned the Group from external volatility in the property sales market and assured a stable income stream. The Group expects to have steady performance from its investment properties. In addition, a newly established business in the property construction segment, generating income of approximately RMB499.4 million during the year under review has further broadened the income base for the Group. Low land cost strategy accompanied with exploration of high potential cities have been applied and remain as key policies of the Group. During the year under review, some land purchases in Pukou, Nanjing will be developed and turned into a focal point for sales contribution in the near future. In addition, joint collaboration in overseas land acquisitions in 2014, including Shouson Hill and Tung Chung in Hong Kong, as well as Taoyuan in Taiwan, will be an economical and practical way to explore the new market and enrich the Group’s land bank abroad, accumulating the total attributable land reserve to GFA of approximately 12.7 million sq.m. as of 31 December 2014. In regard to the capital market financing, the uplifted financing cost and sluggish investment atmosphere correlated with volatility in the property sector have concerned many developers. In light of the industry pick-up at the end of 2014, the Group has successfully issued US$60 million one-year senior notes to Huarong (HK) International Holdings Limited in December 2014 demonstrating confidence from investors in the Group’s prospect. The proceeds has been used for the Group’s principal business, including working capital financing and property development. Together with the Group’s good reputation with strong repayment ability and long-term relationship with the banks, the Group was granted favourable bank loans with lower interest cost. The Group’s creditworthiness was evidenced not only by the complete redemption of the two previously issued convertible bonds in 2014, but also its selection as a constituent of the MSCI Global Small Cap Index since May 2014 and an eligible stock for southbound trading under Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect since November 2014. The selections further recognised the Group’s presence and performance in the stock market. The promotion of various easing facilities, signified by HPRs liberalization and liquidity injection by the PBOC, all acted as catalyst for boosting the property market as well as growth in the national GDP. The prevailing policies have provided a positive and clear direction in the onshore market with current lower interest rate, which facilitates maintaining the supply pipeline at moderate inventory levels as well as inspires a more positive sales outlook. Looking ahead around the globe, despite concerns on the effectiveness of quantitative easing policies adopted in various countries and the expectation of interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve in the second half or third quarter of 2015 which may swing the overall global market, the property market in the PRC, as one of the major economic pillars in the country, is expected to grow modestly and the Group is optimistic about the industry development trend in the years to come. Management For the year ended 31 December 2014, revenue generated by the Group was approximately RMB3,792.6 million (2013: approximately RMB6,269.1 million), representing a decrease of 39.5% as compared to 2013. The decrease in revenue generated from properties sector in 2014 was mainly due to decrease in GFA delivered from 787,024 sq.m. in 2013 to 420,664 sq.m. in 2014. Revenue from various sectors is analyzed as follows: For the year ended Commercial Residential Properties Investment and Property Percentage of (Decrease)/ (RMB’ million) (RMB’ million) (RMB’ million) (RMB’ million) (RMB’ million) (RMB’ million) (39.5%) Revenue from the properties sector contributed 76.4% in total to the Group’s revenue. Revenue from the commercial properties sector decreased by 69.0% which was primarily due to the decrease in delivery of commercial properties in Zhangzhou Mingfa Shopping Mall as most of the pre-sold properties had been delivered upon full completion in 2013 while decrease in revenue from the residential properties sector of 40.7% was mainly due to the decrease in delivery of residential properties in Xiamen Mingfa Xiangwan Peninsula as most of the pre-sold properties had been delivered upon full completion in 2013. Revenue from the properties investment and management sector decreased by 19.1%, which was mainly due to the disposal of certain investment properties during 2014. Income generated from hotel operations increased by 46.7% from RMB80.6 million for 2013 to RMB118.2 million for 2014. It was mainly due to the opening of new hotels in Yangzhou and Hefei, which contributed revenue of RMB10.2 million for 2014 in total. Property construction business was a new business segment in 2014 which generated an income of approximately RMB499.4 million (2013: Nil). The gross profit of the Group decreased in line with revenue and amounted to approximately RMB985.9 million for 2014, representing a decrease of approximately 55.2% as compared to 2013 (2013: approximately RMB2,201.6 million). The profit for the year of the Group decreased by 23.3% from approximately RMB1,376.3 million in 2013 to approximately RMB1,056.2 million in 2014. The profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company was approximately RMB829.3 million for 2014, representing a decrease of approximately RMB569.9 million or approximately 40.7% from 2013 (2013: approximately RMB1,399.2 million). It was mainly due to the decrease in the recognised revenue for 2014 arisen from the decrease in GFA delivered from 787,024 sq.m. in 2013 to 420,664 sq.m. in 2014. The cost of sales of the Group was RMB2,806.7 million for 2014, representing a decrease of approximately 31.0% as compared to 2013 (2013: approximately RMB4,067.5 million). Cost of sales decreased in line with revenue. The average cost of properties included in cost of sales of the Group was RMB4,925.7 per sq.m. for 2014, representing a very small increase of approximately 0.8% over 2013 (2013: average cost of properties included in cost of sales was RMB4,888.8 per sq.m.). Fair value gains on investment properties and derivative financial instruments increased by 165.4% and decreased by 92.9% respectively to RMB1,203.2 million and RMB6.3 million respectively (2013: RMB453.4 million and RMB88.9 million respectively). Fair value gains on investment properties was mainly due to the increase in fair value gains on valuation of Nanjing Mingfa International Industrial Material Park before disposal while the decrease in fair value gains on financial derivative was due to the redemption of 2015 Bonds in early 2014. Other gains decreased by 61.1% from RMB378.7 million in 2013 to RMB147.3 million in 2014. The decrease in other gains was due to decrease in exchange gain generated from RMB depreciation. Management Selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses of the Group were RMB591.2 million in 2014, representing an increase of approximately 9.1% over 2013 (2013: approximately RMB542.1 million). Additional administrative expenses had been incurred for newly established project companies. Net finance costs of the Group decreased by 97.4% to RMB6.9 million in 2014 (2013: approximately RMB267.1 million). The decrease was due to the replacement of borrowings with higher interest cost by those with lower interest cost. Meanwhile, more interest expenses had been capitalised in 2014. As at 31 December 2014, the Group had aggregated cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) of approximately RMB732.1 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB971.2 million). Restricted cash of the Group was RMB2,464.2 million (31 December 2013: RMB1,128.5 million). Bank loans and other borrowings of the Group repayable within one year and after one year were approximately RMB8,217.9 million and RMB3,984.3 million respectively (31 December 2013: approximately RMB6,609.7 million and RMB2,031.7 million respectively). Total interest expenses including the capitalised interest expenses amounted to approximately RMB765.7 million (2013: approximately RMB848.5 million) in total. In addition, interests with an amount of approximately RMB721.9 million (2013: approximately RMB565.5 million) were capitalised in 2014. Set out below are the major ratios of the Group: As at and for the Interest cover (1) Gearing ratio (2) Defined as net debt (total borrowings and derivative financial instruments less cash and cash equivalents and cash restricted for borrowings) As at 31 December 2014, investment properties of the Group with net book value of approximately RMB4,145.4 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB3,850.0 million), buildings of approximately RMB555.2 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB315.6 million), land use rights of approximately RMB3,166.8 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB2,572.4 million), completed properties held for sale of approximately RMB2,734.9 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB1,115.6 million), properties under development of approximately RMB951.6 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB498.1 million), available-for-sale financial assets of approximately RMB50.0 million (31 December 2013: Nil), other non-current assets of approximately RMB268.7 million (31 December 2013: Nil) and restricted bank deposits of approximately RMB2,458.6 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB1,118.0 million) were pledged to secure the banking facilities of the Group. Cash deposits of approximately RMB5.69 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB10.5 million) were restricted and deposited in certain banks as security for bank notes. As at 31 December 2014, the contracted capital commitments of the Group were approximately RMB6,083 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB5,459.2 million), which were mainly the capital commitments for property development and acquisition of the project companies. It is expected that the Group will finance such commitments from internally generated funds and resources. As at 31 December 2014, the contingent liabilities of the Group were approximately RMB4,005.5 million (31 December 2013: approximately RMB4,147.6 million), which were mainly the guarantees given by the Group in favour of certain banks for the grant of mortgage loans to buyers of the Group’s properties. Such guarantees will be released following completion of transfer of property title by the Group to the buyers. As at 31 December 2014, the balance of the bank deposits maintained by the Group (including restricted bank balances) consisted of Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars and US dollars in the respective proportions of 92.0%, 1.2% and 6.8% (31 December 2013: Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars and US dollars accounted for 89.4%, 0.5% and 10.1% respectively of the total bank balances of the Group). The bank loans and other borrowings maintained by the Group were denominated in Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, US dollars and New Taiwan dollars in respective proportions of 63.1%, 19.0%, 17.2% and 0.7% (31 December 2013: Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars and US dollars accounted for 61.3%, 27.5% and 11.2% respectively of the total bank loans and other borrowings of the Group). As the sales, purchases, bank borrowings and other borrowings of the Group in 2014 were made mainly in Renminbi and Hong Kong dollars, and it is expected that the majority of future development and transactions carried out by the Group will be made and transacted either in Renminbi or Hong Kong dollars, the Group will convert the Hong Kong dollars and US dollars bank balances into Renminbi as and when required to minimize any foreign exchange risk. The Group did not adopt any foreign exchange hedging instruments to hedge against foreign exchange risk in 2014, and the Group believes that the foreign exchange risk exposed by the Group was relatively minimal. Management As at 31 December 2014, the majority of the bank borrowings of the Group were floating rate borrowings and were denominated in Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars and US dollars, whereby any upward fluctuations in interest rates will increase the interest costs of the Group in connection with such loans or any new loans obtained by the Group calculated on a floating interest rate basis. The Group currently does not use any derivative instruments to hedge against its interest rate risk. The Group utilizes cash flows generated from operating activities and bank loans to finance its operations, construction and capital expenditure; to increase its land banks; to discharge its debt and to ensure the continuous growth of the Group’s business. As at 31 December 2014, the Group employed a total of 2,412 staff (31 December 2013: 2,445 staff). There were no material changes in the number of staff. For 2014, the staff costs of the Group including Directors’ emoluments were approximately RMB231.1 million (2013: approximately RMB212.0 million), representing an increase of approximately 9.0%. The increase was mainly due to the annual salary adjustment. The staff costs include basic salary and welfare expenses, whereby employees’ welfare covered a medical insurance plan, a pension plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a pregnancy insurance plan and training. The Group values human capital and is keen to improve the professionalism and competitiveness of employees through training and regular performance reviews. The Group provided various trainings for accounting teams in relation to the latest reporting requirements and standards. The Group’s employees are engaged according to the terms and provisions of their employment contracts. In practice, the Group annually conducts reviews on the remuneration packages and performance appraisal with employees which are taken into account for bonus entitlement and promotion assessment. The Group also studies and compares its remuneration packages with those of its peers and competitors and will make adjustments whenever necessary so as to maintain its competitiveness in the employment market. The Group maintains different pension schemes and retirement schemes for its employees in different locations in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. The Group has participated in the mandatory provident fund scheme (the “MPF Scheme”) for all employees in Hong Kong. The MPF Scheme is registered with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance (Chapter 485 of the Laws of Hong Kong). The assets of the MPF Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of an independent trustee. Under the MPF Scheme, the employer and its employees are each required to make contributions to the MPF Scheme at specified rates. In relation to the employees in the PRC, the PRC Government also imposes compulsory requirements for all PRC business enterprises to participate in the state-managed retirement benefit scheme. The employees of the PRC subsidiaries of the Group are members of the state-managed retirement benefit scheme, and these PRC subsidiaries are obligated to contribute certain percentage of payroll costs to the state-managed retirement benefit scheme. There was no forfeited contribution under the scheme available for deduction of future contribution to be made by the Group. For 2014, the contribution to the above MPF Scheme and retirement benefit scheme made by the Group amounted to approximately RMB23.1 million (2013: approximately RMB22.6 million).

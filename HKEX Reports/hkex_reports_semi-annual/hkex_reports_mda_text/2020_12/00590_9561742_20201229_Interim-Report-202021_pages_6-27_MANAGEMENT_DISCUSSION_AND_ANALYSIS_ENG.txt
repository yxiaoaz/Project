As a result of the substantial decline in the number of visitors due to the continuing impact of pandemic, retail sentiment in the Hong Kong and Macau market has been weakening. According to the statistics on visitor arrivals to Hong Kong published by the Hong Kong Tourism Board in October 2020, Mainland visitors from January to September 2020 fell by 92.7% year-on-year to 2.70 million. In respect of tourist spending, according to the retail sales figures released by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong in November 2020, the sales value of jewellery, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts from January to September 2020 decreased by 59.6% over the corresponding period last year.

However, because of the increase in gold hedging loss by HK$17 million in its business during the Period under review, the business turned from a profit to loss, resulting to a segment loss of HK$11,495,000 (2019: profit of HK$29,256,000), accounting for -2.8% (2019: 3.5%) of the total. Its segment profit margin was -11.7% (2019: 50.5%).

During the Period under review, with the high gold price and the continuing impact of the pandemic, retail revenue from the Mainland market declined by 26.9% to HK$689,436,000 (2019: HK$943,121,000), accounting for 20.6% (2019: 15.0%) of the Group’s total revenue.

If including inter-segment sales in the denominator, the segment profit margin of wholesale business would be 11.5% (2019: 8.2%). As the increase in the number of licensed shops in Mainland offset the impact of other unfavourable factors, licensing income in the Mainland market fell by 6.3% only to HK$383,438,000 (2019: HK$409,332,000), accounting for 11.5% (2019: 6.5%) of the Group’s total revenue.

In order to align with the branding theme of “Love is Beauty”, the Group has been building a welcoming and warm-hearted brand image, strengthening customers’ recognition and emotional attachment to the brand, and striving to become a globally recognised jewellery brand through outstanding marketing campaigns and excellent customer service programmes. Targeting the mid- to high-end markets, the Group has adopted effective marketing strategies to keep abreast of the times, and launched diversified product offerings with exquisite designs, together with sincere services to seize the business opportunities in the middle-class, wedding and kids markets. The Group capitalised on different promotional channels to further enhance its brand awareness. We also kept pace with the rapid growth of online marketing by placing advertisements on major social media platforms and search engines. Moreover, the Group has continued to be appointed as the official partner for Tencent’s famous mobile game “King Pro League” champion rings for seven consecutive seasons, with a view to enhancing our brand’s penetration into the market of younger generation. As the Group’s anniversary this year fell on the day of Double Seventh Festival, we invited our global brand ambassador Mr. Li Yi Feng to show up and interact with audience at the live-streaming event, which recorded over 12 million views that effectively enhanced brand awareness and created hot topics. In addition, we also held a contest on the popular social media platform Xiaohongshu, which recorded over 10 million views, so as to raise Lukfook’s brand awareness among young consumers. The Group also sponsored medals for marathons in various regions to penetrate the middle-class customers. Furthermore, the Group participated in wedding expos and a series of promotional activities to seize the business opportunities in the wedding market. Besides, we actively adopted multi-brand strategy, and strived to develop more new brands, apart from “Dear Q” and “Goldstyle”, to cater for the tastes of different customer groups. The Group’s full efforts in escalating brand value and influence have been recognised with numerous awards from the industry and market for its outstanding achievements in branding, corporate governance, customer service, community welfare and environmental protection. As the border restrictions have not been fully lifted in Hong Kong, Macau and Mainland under the ongoing pandemic, same store sales in the Hong Kong and Macau market still fell notably yet at a slower pace. Same store sales for self-operated and licensed shops in the Mainland market recorded a much smaller decline due to more effective control of the pandemic in Mainland and gradual improvement of consumer sentiment. The retail atmosphere in the market gradually recovered. The same store sales of Hong Kong and Macau market were around -40% in October 2020 and -30% in the first three weeks of November, which were further improved from the -46% in September 2020. Besides, the overall same store sales of the Mainland market, including both self-operated and licensed shops recorded a low single digit growth in October 2020 and a high single digit growth in the first three weeks of November, a turnaround from negative to positive as compared to the -5% in September 2020. As it would take some time for the Mainland tourists to come back to Hong Kong and for the retail atmosphere to resume normal, the Group will net reduce 2 shops in Hong Kong, and seek opportunities to net add 2 shops in Macau in the current financial year. Besides, the Group will keep on freezing salary and maintaining natural turnover measures for the upcoming year and continue to negotiate with shop landlords seeking for rental concessions so as to reduce costs. In view of the anticipated considerable growth of the middle-class population in Mainland, the Group remains optimistic about the mid- to long-term business prospects, and will focus its expansion in the Mainland market. The Group looks forward to regaining business growth in the near future. The Group has set up its new three-year corporate strategy in the last financial year with Supply Chain Management, Mainland Market Expansion and Strategic Growth as its three main focuses so as to foster its future business development. In order to further enhance its competitive edge, the Group will focus on strengthening supply chain management through various means. The Group will try its best endeavour to identify right product, set right price and offer products to market at the right time by implementing higher level of automation and big data management; improving factory productivity; improving inventory turnover period; establishing strategic partnership with suppliers; streamlining logistics on distribution and intensifying support to licensees, with a hope that all these would help promote business development and strengthen operational efficiency and effectiveness. As Mainland remains to be a market with growth potential in the mid- to long-term, the Group will continue to focus on business expansion in Mainland. The target for net addition of “Lukfook” shops in Mainland for this financial year will be adjusted upward to around 250 shops, mainly focused on opening licensed shops in fourth- and fifth-tier cities, while the target for net addition of new brands’ stores in Mainland is 50 shops, which will also be mainly licensed shops. The Group is also committed to further developing its e-commerce business and strengthening cooperation with various e-commerce platforms in Mainland, aiming to sustain the growth in e-commerce revenue at a target of 15% growth in this financial year. In light of the enormous spending potential of young consumers on online sales platforms, the Group will step up its efforts to promote the sales of affordable luxury jewellery products to expand its footprint in the young consumer market. The Group has already adopted multi-brand strategy, and strives to develop more new brands in the future, apart from “Goldstyle” and “Dear Q”. In addition, the Group will adopt holistic approach to penetrate into the markets for the middle-class, wedding couples and kids by understanding customers’ spending habits. It will also continue to attract customers and encourage local consumption by visual merchandising enhancement, cross-selling boosting and VIP promotional activities, so as to improve sales and profits. Given the importance of social media in product promotion, the Group will continue to showcase and promote its products on mobile applications and social media platforms such as Facebook, Weibo and WeChat, etc. With the strong financial position, the Board has resolved to declare an interim dividend of HK$0.225 per ordinary share and a special dividend of HK$0.275 per ordinary share, totalling HK$0.50 per ordinary share (2019: HK$0.50 per share) for the six months ended 30 September 2020, to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 11 December 2020.

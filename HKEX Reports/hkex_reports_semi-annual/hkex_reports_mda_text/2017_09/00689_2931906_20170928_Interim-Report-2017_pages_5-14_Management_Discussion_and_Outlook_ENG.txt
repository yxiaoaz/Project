During the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group continued to principally engage in the business of petroleum exploration and production, money lending and investment in securities. The Group reported revenue of HK$27,439,000 for the current period, increased by 3% compared to the previous period (30 June 2016: HK$26,548,000) that was mainly due to the rise of interest income generated from the money lending and investment in securities businesses, though such increase was partly offset by the decline in revenue of the petroleum business as a result of the drop in average selling price and volume of crude oil produced by the Group’s petroleum operation. During the first half of 2017, the Group continued to engage in petroleum exploration and production in the Chañares Herrados Area (“CHE Area”) and Puesto Pozo Cercado Area (“PPC Area”) (together the “Concessions”) in the Cuyana Basin, Mendoza Province of Argentina. Chañares Herrados Empresa de Trabajos Petroleros S.A. (“Chañares”) was the concessionaire of the Concessions (the “Concessionaire”). On 2 December 2010, Southstart Limited (“Southstart”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Chañares entered into a joint venture agreement (“JV Agreement”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, among others, EP Energy S.A. (“EP Energy”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southstart, has the right to drill and invest in the Concessions and is entitled to share 72% of hydrocarbon production from the wells drilled by EP Energy in the current and future years until the end of the Concessions. On 5 June 2012, EP Energy, Have Result Investments Limited (“Have Result”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Chañares entered into an operation agreement (the “Operation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Operation Agreement, among others, Chañares agreed to release EP Energy from the investment commitment in the JV Agreement, whereas EP Energy retains the right to drill and invest in the Concessions during the life of the Concessions. The Operation Agreement confirmed that Have Result is entitled to 51% interest on the production of 5 oil wells and EP Energy is entitled to 72% interest on the production of 5 other oil wells. During the review period, the Group continued to focus on the investment to improve the production of and had performed maintenance works for the 10 existing producing oil wells. At 30 June 2017, the Group had finished drilling of 10 oil wells in the CHE Area. For the period under review, the Group’s petroleum exploration and production business generated revenue of HK$21,639,000 (30 June 2016: HK$25,302,000) and recorded a loss of HK$73,000 (30 June 2016: HK$319,000). The decline of the operation’s revenue was partly due to the drop in production volume of crude oil by about 3% when compared with the prior period, and partly due to the decrease in sales price of crude oil offered by YPF S.A., an Argentina state-owned oil company and the sole buyer of the operation’s output, from on average US$58.8 per barrel for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$51.4 per barrel for the current period. Nevertheless, the drop in the operation’s revenue was compensated by the decrease in the field operating expenses and increase in other gain with the result that a smaller operating loss of only HK$73,000 was recorded. BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Petroleum Exploration and Production (continued) The Group performed an impairment review on the exploration and evaluation assets, oil and gas properties and other tax recoverables at 30 June 2017 and determined that there would be no reversal of impairment losses on these assets. The Group also reconsidered the future development of the investment plan on the Concessions at 30 June 2017 and concluded that no further well drilling programme will be launched at present. References are made to the announcement of the Company dated 25 August 2016 and the annual report of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 disclosing that the Group was notified by the Concessionaire of the Concessions that the department of hydrocarbons of the government of Mendoza (the “Mendoza Government”) has been reviewing the fulfilment of the terms and conditions of the 10- year extension of the Concessions till 2027 (the “Extension”) previously awarded to the Concessionaire, particularly the status of the investment commitment of the Concessionaire. As disclosed in the announcement of the Company dated 15 August 2017, the Group was notified by the Concessionaire that the Executive of the Province of Mendoza published two decrees on 9 August 2017 to the effect that (i) it has accepted the investment commitment plan submitted by the Concessionaire in respect of the Extension for the CHE Area; and (ii) it declared the lapse of the concession in respect of the PPC Area by 30 October 2017. The Concessionaire also advised the Group that based on its discussions with the Mendoza Government, the concession in respect of CHE Area will be extended until 14 November 2027. The Company is requesting the Concessionaire to obtain written confirmation from the Mendoza Government on the exact period of the Extension and is at the same time seeking advice from the Group’s legal adviser in Argentina on this matter. Further disclosure on this matter will be made by the Company to shareholders as and when appropriate. In light of the above, it is the intention of the Group to continue its participation in the operations and sharing of interest on the production of the 10 oil wells drilled in the CHE Area. As regards the PPC Area, as no oil wells have been drilled or are in operations and the Group’s exploration and evaluation assets in respect of its right over the hydrocarbon production from the PPC Area was fully impaired in the year ended 31 December 2015, the Board considers that the lapse of the concession in respect of the PPC Area would not have material adverse effect on the business, financial positions or prospects of the Group. During six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group’s money lending business achieved a significant increase in revenue and operating profit by reporting HK$4,323,000 (30 June 2016: HK$446,000) and HK$4,447,000 (30 June 2016: HK$294,000) respectively. These encouraging results were mainly attributed to the increase in scale of this operation and the Group had applied part of the new funds raised from the convertible notes issued in April 2017 for funding the lending activities. BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Money Lending (continued) At 30 June 2017, the loans portfolio held by the Group amounting to HK$99,000,000 with details as follows: Approximate weighting to the value of the Group’s Interest rate During the period under review, there was no impairment loss recognised against the loan receivables. Before granting loans to potential borrowers, the Group uses internal credit assessment process to assess the potential borrower’s credit quality and defines its credit limits granted to the borrowers. The credit limits attributed to the borrowers are reviewed by the management regularly. The Group generally acquires securities listed on the Stock Exchange or other recognised stock exchanges and over-the-counter markets with good liquidity that can facilitate swift execution of securities transactions. For making investment or divestment decision on securities of individual target company, references will usually be made to the latest financial information, news and announcements issued by the target company, investment analysis reports that the Company has access to, as well as industry or macro-economic news. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held for long-term purpose, particular emphasis will be placed on the past financial performance of the target company including its sales and profit growth, financial healthiness, dividend policy, business prospect, industry and macro-economic outlook. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held other than for long-term purpose, in addition to the factors mentioned, reference will also be made to prevailing market sentiments on different sectors of the investment markets. In terms of return, for long-term securities investments, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of capital appreciation and dividend/interest income. For securities investment other than for long-term holding, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of trading gains. For the period under review, the Group’s investment in securities operation held a financial asset investment portfolio valued at HK$95,009,000, comprising Hong Kong listed equity securities and oversea listed debt securities, and an available-for-sale investment portfolio valued at HK$107,183,000, comprising debt securities listed in Hong Kong and oversea. As a whole, the operation recorded a revenue of HK$1,477,000 (30 June 2016: HK$800,000) and a profit of HK$11,655,000 (30 June 2016: loss of HK$529,000). BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Investment in Securities (continued) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) At 30 June 2017, the Group held a financial assets investment portfolio comprising financial assets at FVTPL amounting to HK$95,009,000 (31 December 2016: HK$27,454,000) measured at market/fair value. During the review period, the Group’s financial asset at FVTPL portfolio generated a revenue of HK$531,000 (30 June 2016: HK$800,000) representing dividends from equity securities of HK$275,000 (30 June 2016: HK$800,000) and interest income from debt securities of HK$256,000 (30 June 2016: nil). The Group recognised a net gain on financial assets at FVTPL of HK$10,640,000, which comprised net unrealised gain on securities held at the period end and net realised gain on disposal of securities of HK$1,152,000 and HK$9,488,000 respectively (30 June 2016: net loss of HK$1,090,000, which comprised net unrealised gain on securities held at the period end and net realised loss on disposal of securities of HK$2,766,000 and HK$3,856,000 respectively). Such gain from investments in financial assets at FVTPL was due primarily to the general upturn of the Hong Kong stock market during the first half of 2017. At 30 June 2017, the Group invested in different category of companies and their weightings to the market/fair value of the Group’s financial asset at FVTPL portfolio of HK$95,009,000 are as below: Approximate weighting to the market/ fair value of the Group’s financial asset at FVTPL BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Investment in Securities (continued) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) (continued) At 30 June 2017, the weightings of the Group’s top five investments to the market/fair value of the Group’s securities investment portfolio of HK$95,009,000 (together with other information) were as below: Investee company’s name and its principal activities# Approximate weighting to the market/ fair value of the Group’s securities investment % of shareholding Acquisition *Acquisition costs during the period/ carrying amount as at 1 January Market/fair value as at 30 June Accumulated unrealised gain (loss) recognised up to 30 June Unrealised gain (loss) recognised during the six months ended 30 June 2017 Dividend received/ receivable during the period ended 30 June 2017 #Investee company’s #Future prospects of (stock code: 163) Lease of properties, properties development, For the year ended 31 March 2017, revenue decreased by 27% to HK$4,068,467,000 while its results experienced a turnaround and recorded a profit for the year of HK$3,690,800,000 compared to 2016.

BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Investment in Securities (continued) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) (continued) BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Investment in Securities (continued) At 30 June 2017, the Group’s AFS investment portfolio of HK$107,183,000 (31 December 2016: nil) was measured at market/fair value. During the period under review, the Group’s AFS investment portfolio generated total revenue amounting to HK$946,000 (30 June 2016: nil) representing interest income on listed debt securities held. According to the maturity of the AFS investments, part of the AFS investment portfolio of HK$3,100,000 is classified as current assets. During the period under review, the Group invested approximately HK$109,585,000 to subscribe for bonds in the aggregate principal amount of US$14,000,000 issued by an aircraft leasing company and six property companies listed on the Stock Exchange. At the period end, a fair value loss on these bond investments amounting to HK$2,402,000 (30 June 2016: nil), determined by referencing to market prices, was recognised as other comprehensive expense. At 30 June 2017, the Group invested in bonds issued by an aircraft leasing company and six property companies as AFS investments and their respective weighting to the market/fair value of the Group’s AFS investment portfolio of HK$107,183,000 (together with other information) are as below: Approximate weighting to the market/fair value of the Group’s AFS investment Yield to maturity on acquisition Acquisition *Acquisition costs during the period/ carrying amount as at 1 January 2017 Market/fair value as at 30 June 2017 Accumulated fair value loss recognised up to 30 June 2017 Fair value loss recognised during the period ended 30 June 2017 The amount represented the acquisition costs for the securities during the six months ended 30 June 2017 and/or the carrying amount of the securities brought forward from the prior financial year after accounting for additional acquisition and/or disposal of the securities (if any) during the current period. For the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group reported a loss for the period of HK$60,943,000 (30 June 2016: HK$28,516,000) that was mainly attributed to the recognition of the share-based payments expense, which was non-cash in nature, of HK$73,257,000 (30 June 2016: nil) recorded for the grant of share options to directors and employees on 4 May 2017, despite the profitable results contributed by the money lending and investment in securities businesses and the decrease of corporate expenses by 88% to HK$2,598,000 (30 June 2016: HK$20,808,000). Basic loss per share was HK1.4 cents and increased by HK0.5 cent compared to the prior period (30 June 2016: HK0.9 cent). If the effect of the share-based payments expense was excluded, the Group would have, for illustrative purpose, reported a profit of HK$12,314,000 for the current period which essentially reflects the operating results of the Group. On 11 April 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor for the subscription of the 3% convertible notes in aggregate principal amount of HK$80,000,000 which could be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at an initial conversion price of HK$0.36 per share (the “CN Subscription”). The completion of the CN Subscription took place on 26 April 2017 and net proceeds of HK$79,852,000 were raised. The Company intended to use approximately 50% of the net proceeds as working capital for the money lending business and the remaining for the investment in securities business of the Group. At 30 June 2017, part of the net proceeds had been utilised for the lending and investment activities of the Group. The Group recorded a fair value gain on the issuance of convertible notes amounting to HK$3,575,000. Further details of the issuance of convertible notes were set out in the announcements of the Company dated 11 April 2017 and 26 April 2017. During the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group financed its operation mainly by cash generated from its operations, net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and shareholders’ funds. At the period end, the Group had current assets of HK$303,871,000 (31 December 2016: HK$325,119,000) and liquid assets comprising bank balances and cash as well as financial assets at FVTPL totalling HK$189,222,000 (31 December 2016: HK$209,658,000). The Group’s current ratio, calculated based on current assets over current liabilities of HK$15,602,000 (31 December 2016: HK$21,892,000), was at a strong ratio of about 19.5 (31 December 2016: 14.9). At 30 June 2017, the Group’s trade and other receivables and prepayments amounted to HK$11,263,000 (31 December 2016: HK$11,996,000), which mainly comprised deposit placed as escrow for the petroleum exploration and production operation, amount placed with securities brokers in relation to securities trading activities and interest receivables from AFS investments and money lending business. At 30 June 2017, the net assets of the Group amounted to HK$355,754,000, which slightly increased by HK$9,912,000 compared to the prior financial year end (31 December 2016: HK$345,842,000). The Group’s gearing ratio, calculated on the basis of total liabilities of HK$90,751,000 (31 December 2016: HK$21,892,000) divided by total assets of HK$446,505,000 (31 December 2016: HK$367,734,000), was about 20% (31 December 2016: 6%). The finance costs for the period amounted to HK$1,272,000, which represented the effective interest on convertible notes issued in April 2017 (30 June 2016: HK$4,042,000, representing mainly interest on bank borrowings which were fully repaid in November 2016). With the amount of liquid assets on hand, the management is of the view that the Group has sufficient financial resources to meet its ongoing operational requirements. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capital Structure (continued) On 16 June 2017, the Company entered into a placing agreement with a placing agent whereby the Company conditionally agreed to place, through the placing agent, on a best effort basis, up to 651,000,000 new shares of the Company to not less than six independent placees at the placing price of HK$0.308 per share (the “Placing”). The Placing was completed on 4 July 2017. The maximum amount of gross proceeds from the Placing was approximately HK$200,500,000. The Company presently intends to use the entire maximum amount of net proceeds of approximately HK$195,300,000 from the Placing as general working capital for the Group’s money lending and investment in securities businesses which require readily available funds in order to operate such businesses. However, part of the net proceeds from the Placing may be applied towards funding investment opportunities which may arise from time to time and which the Board considers to be in the interest of the Company to make such investment. Further details of the placing were set out in the announcements of the Company dated 16 June 2017 and 4 July 2017. The monetary assets and liabilities as well as business transactions of the Group are mainly denominated in HK$, US$ and ARS. During the period under review, the Group had not experienced any significant exchange rate exposure to US$ as HK$ and US$ exchange rate is pegged. As for the Group’s petroleum operation in Argentina, the oil selling proceeds are quoted at US$ and converted into ARS for settlement at official exchange rate on a monthly basis, and a majority of the investment and operating costs including infrastructure and equipment, drilling costs, completion costs and workover jobs are based on US$ and converted into ARS for payments. The Group currently does not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy for ARS, however, the management regularly monitors foreign exchange exposure of ARS and will undertake appropriate hedging measures should significant exposures arise. At 30 June 2017, the Group had no significant contingent liability (31 December 2016: nil). At 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2016, the following assets were pledged to secure the Group’s bank borrowings: (i) the entire issued share capital of EP Energy, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; (ii) the entire issued share capital of Have Result, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; (iii) the entire issued share capital of two direct wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company which together hold the entire issued share capital of EP Energy. At 30 June 2017, the Group had fully repaid the bank borrowings. As the release of the security pledged was still in process, the above assets were still regarded as pledged assets of the Group. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) At 30 June 2017, the Group had no significant capital commitment (31 December 2016: nil). At 30 June 2017, the Group had a total 27 (30 June 2016: 27) employees including directors of the Company with 20 (30 June 2016: 19) employees in Hong Kong and PRC and 7 (30 June 2016: 8) employees in Argentina. Staff costs (including directors’ emoluments) amounted to HK$5,095,000 (30 June 2016: HK$9,199,000) for the period under review. The remuneration packages for directors and staff are normally reviewed annually and are structured by reference to prevailing market terms and individual competence, performance and experience. The Group operates a Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme for employees in Hong Kong and operates employees’ pension schemes for employees in Argentina. In addition, the Group provides other employee benefits which include medical insurance, share option scheme and discretionary bonus. For the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group’s petroleum exploration and production operation continued to record loss, though small, of HK$73,000 as business conditions of the operation remained challenging. Local oil selling price in Argentina remained hovering at low levels at an average of about US$51.0 per barrel during the current period and this price pattern is expected to continue in the second half of 2017. As for the money lending business, the Group will continue to develop this business under prudent credit management and intends that this business will continue to contribute a stable and favorable income stream to the Group in future years. The investment and stock markets in Hong Kong have been rather volatile recently and the management will continue to take a cautious approach in managing the Group’s listed equity and debt investments portfolio. Looking forward, the management will continue to develop the Group’s existing businesses and will step up its effort to improve the Group’s financial performance. The management will also seize business and investment opportunities with good prospects aiming to create value to shareholders. As referred to in the Company’s announcement dated 4 July 2017, the Company is in preliminary discussion with potential partners to co-operate to invest in the development of cloud computing business but has not entered into any written agreement in relation to such potential investment. Further announcement on this matter will be made by the Company to shareholders as and when appropriate.

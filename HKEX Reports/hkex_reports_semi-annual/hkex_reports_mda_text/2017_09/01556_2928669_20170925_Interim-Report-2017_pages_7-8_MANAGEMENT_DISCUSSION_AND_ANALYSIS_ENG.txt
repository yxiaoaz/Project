During the period under review, the Group’s total gross profit was HK$162.93 million as compared with the corresponding period of last year of HK$208.58 million, representing a decrease of 21.89%. The decrease of total gross profit is related to the decrease in revenues during this reporting period. At the same time, the gross profit margin of 27.57% is higher than last year’s margin for the corresponding period of 23.54%. The increase in gross profit margin is the result of successful ongoing implementations of stringent project cost control policies. In addition, during this period we came to terms with our customers on final project accounts for certain completed projects. This led to recording additional project income for this period while the corresponding construction costs were accrued in previous periods, thus leading to higher gross profit margin. The Group’s administrative expenses decreased to HK$104.96 million compared to last year’s corresponding period of HK$133.69 million. This represents a decrease of 21.49%. Last year’s administrative expenses were higher because of losses of HK$14.94 million incurred on the disposal of items of property, plant and equipment. There was no markdown for similar disposals this year. Additional savings were the result of a decrease in administrative expenses attributable to our stringent control of overhead costs. The Group’s net profit for the period was HK$49.70 million, representing a decrease of 19.41% over last year’s the corresponding period of HK$61.67 million. The decrease in net profit was due directly to the decrease in gross profit but the magnitude of the decrease was partly set-off by the decrease of administrative expenses. The Group maintained a sound financial position during the period under review. As at 30 June 2017, the Group had unpledged cash and bank balances of HK$214.09 million as compared with that of HK$312.13 million as at 31 December 2016. This difference was mainly due to the payment of a 2016 final dividend of HK$60.00 million as well as a cash payment of HK$54.93 million for investments in plant and equipment.

China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 China Power International Development Limited (the “Company” or “China Power”), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group” or “we”) is principally engaged in generation and sales of electricity in Mainland China, including investment, development, operation and management of coal-fired power, hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic power plants. Its businesses are located in the major power grid regions of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). In the first half of 2017, the national total electricity consumption rose by 6.30% when compared with the corresponding period last year, extending the trend of accelerated growth arisen since the second half of 2016. As the reform on power industry deepened in progress, the electricity market for direct trades between power generation enterprises and large-volume electricity end-users (“direct power supply”) is opening and competing in an orderly manner. In the first half of 2017, the Group’s total electricity sold was 29,639,547MWh, representing a decrease of 8.94% when compared with the corresponding period last year, and profit attributable to owners of the Company was RMB425,138,000, representing a decrease of 77.93% when compared with the corresponding period last year. Basic earnings per share was RMB0.06, representing a decrease of 76.92% when compared with the corresponding period last year. As at 30 June 2017, net assets per share, excluding non-controlling interest, was RMB3.60. During the period under review, the Group continued to accelerate corporate transformation in various aspects: Continued to develop clean energy – The Group’s total installed capacity of clean energy increased by 155MW during the period under review, and the share of installed capacity of clean energy expanded further. Development of wind power and photovoltaic power projects achieved satisfactory progress during the first half of the year. The Group is constructing a photovoltaic power station integrated with agricultural facilities in Shandong Province of the PRC and has established a joint venture to develop offshore wind power business. Coal-fired power generating units have been comprehensively upgraded and renovated on a continual basis with notable effects in the reduction of pollutant emissions. Accelerated the development of integrated energy – The Group has been developing the heat supply market actively and continuing to increase the production capacity for heat supply. During the period under review, total heat sold (including an associate and a joint venture) increased by 8.14% when compared with the corresponding period last year and the sources of revenue expanded. Significant efforts were devoted to develop integrated energy (i.e. to supply power, heat, cold energy and industrial water simultaneously to users). The integrated energy projects in Guangdong Jiangmen and Sichuan Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone have obtained approvals from their respective local government and have been preparing for construction works, while the integrated energy project in Anhui Hefei has also been progressing smoothly. Strived to increase income and curb expenditures – During the period under review, the power generation volume of new wind power plants and photovoltaic power stations increased significantly compared with the corresponding period last year which narrowed the reduction in the overall electricity sales in the first half of the year. As of 30 June 2017, the Group had seventeen coal-fired power generating units (including an associate) which were granted tariff subsidies for ultra-low emissions, the income from the coal- fired power segment was positively enhanced. To control fuel costs, the Group strived to deepen the cooperative relationship with major coal suppliers and ensure full delivery of medium to long term coal contracts to stabilize coal supply and prices. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 For the first half of 2017, the details of power generation and electricity sold of the Group are set out as follows: For the first half of 2017, the details of electricity sold of the Group’s main associate and joint venture are set out as follows: For the first half of 2017, total electricity sold of the Group dropped by 8.94% compared with the corresponding period last year. In respect of the coal-fired power in the first half of this year, the Group arranged suspension of several coal-fired power generating units with large capacities for ultra-low-emission improvement works and routine check-up and repairs, and the electricity sales of the coal-fired power decreased by 2.95% year-on-year. In respect of hydropower, due to the exceptional ample rainfall along the river basins where the Group’s hydropower plants are located in the same period last year, the electricity sales in the first half of this year dropped by 23.28% when comparing with the high base figure in the same period last year. However, the total electricity sold of the hydropower in the first half of this year was within the normal range compared to the historical average level recorded in the same period. Electricity sales of wind power and photovoltaic power were significantly up by 106.54% and 559.10% respectively year-on-year in the Group’s vigorous effort on promoting the development of clean energy. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 For the first half of 2017, total heat sold by the Group (including an associate and a joint venture) was 7,063,845GJ, representing an increase of 531,911GJ or 8.14% compared to the corresponding period last year. In recent years, the Group has started to develop heat supply projects and to carry out transformation of existing coal-fired power generating units suitable for heat supply. The use of residual heat as a new source to secure profit growth helped enhancing the utilization of energy integration as well as aligning with the direction of government emphasis on environmental protection and achieving the goal on energy saving and consumption reduction. As of 30 June 2017, ten power generating units of the Group (including an associate) have completed the heat supply renovation and another two power generating units are expected to be completed the same within 2017. The Group actively participated in the national power industrial market reform and closely tracked the relevant policy changes with the parties concerned to establish a more standardized and more orderly competitive mechanism for direct power supply trading. For the first half of 2017, a number of coal-fired power plants of the Group participated in the direct power supply transactions, the electricity sold through direct power supply transactions was 6,779,703MWh, accounting for approximately 22.87% of the Group’s total electricity sales. Direct power supply is a kind of electricity market trading behavior, the tariffs will vary with the market supply and demand situation and thus the average on-grid tariffs will fluctuate more than in the past. For the first half of 2017, the average post-tax tariffs for those power plants of the Group which participated in direct power supply transactions was at a discount of approximately 7.75% as compared with the average post-tax benchmark on-grid tariffs. For the first half of 2017, the Group’s average on-grid tariffs compared to the corresponding period last year: coal-fired power was RMB309.28/MWh, representing a decrease of RMB2.31/MWh; hydropower was RMB286.11/MWh, representing a decrease of RMB20.69/MWh; photovoltaic power was RMB800.37/MWh, representing a decrease of RMB7.86/MWh. The decrease in the average on-grid tariff of hydropower was mainly due to the downward adjustments of on- grid tariffs for hydropower plants located in Hunan Province since 1 September 2016. The decrease in the average on-grid tariff of wind power was mainly due to some wind power plants in certain regions charged at lower on-grid tariffs in place of the power generation from coal-fired power plants. The Group will continue to closely monitor the development of the environmental protection policies of the PRC government and strengthen the research on the green energy tariff policies in order to actively seek for more green energy subsidies and to increase revenue. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 For the first half of 2017, the average unit fuel cost of the Group’s coal-fired power business was approximately RMB212.58/MWh, representing an increase of approximately 68.74% from that of approximately RMB125.98/ MWh of the corresponding period last year. Since the second half of last year, market coal prices rose rapidly, coal prices continued to hover at high levels in the first half of this year resulted in a surge in fuel costs year- on-year. During the period under review, in order to keep the increment of fuel costs under control, the Group strengthened the management over coal procurement by enlarging the scale of centralized procurement, optimizing the coal inventory level with instant response to the rapid market changes, and seeking new coal supply channels to enhance our bargaining power. For the first half of 2017, the net coal consumption rate of the Group was 303.03g/KWh, representing an increase of 0.12g/KWh as compared with the corresponding period last year, which was mainly due to several coal-fired power generating units suspended during the period under review for the ultra-low-emission improvement works which reduced the power generation, and the new environmental friendly facilities increased the house consumption of the power plants which affected the coal consumption slightly. In recent years, some of the Group’s environmental friendly power generating units with large capacity and high parameter have commenced operation successively which has achieved substantial effect on energy saving and emission reduction, and also has helped to maintain the net coal consumption rate at a low level. For the first half of 2017, the average utilization hours of coal-fired power generating units of the Group was 1,745 hours, representing a decrease of 49 hours as compared with the corresponding period last year. Followed by the series of measures launched by the PRC government to control the pace of coal-fired power development, the national growth rate of newly-installed coal-fired power generating capacity fell year-on-year, and thus the fall in the average utilization rate of the Group’s coal-fired power generating units has also slowed down. The average utilization hours of hydropower generating units was 1,917 hours, representing a decrease of 597 hours as compared with the corresponding period last year, mainly impacted by the relatively high base figure in the same period last year. The average utilization hours of wind power generating units was 936 hours, representing an increase of 105 hours as compared with the corresponding period last year. For the first half of 2017, the net profit of the Group amounted to RMB739,999,000, representing a decrease of RMB1,870,194,000 as compared with the corresponding period last year. During the period under review, clean energy business (hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic power) kept making significant profit contribution to the Group, while coal-fired power business reported an operating loss as a result of the substantial rise in fuel costs. For the first half of 2017, the net profits and losses from the principal business segments and their respective ratio of contribution to the total net profit are as follows: net profit from hydropower was RMB890,310,000 (120.3%, 2016: 50.5%); net loss from coal-fired power was RMB271,700,000 (-36.7%, 2016: 48.5%). China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 As compared with the first half of 2016, the decrease in net profit was mainly due to the following factors: an increase in fuel costs of RMB1,643,040,000 due to the sustained high coal prices during the period which resulted in the surge in unit fuel cost by RMB86.60/MWh or 68.74%; as a result of electricity sold for both hydropower and coal-fired power reported a decrease, and the decrease in average on-grid tariff of hydropower; the revenue of hydropower and coal-fired power the decrease in the share of profits of associates and joint ventures by RMB274,093,000. However, part of the net profit decrease for the period under review was offset by the following key factor: operating costs (apart from fuel costs and depreciation) reduced by RMB633,690,000 on account of the Group’s effort made on cost control. The revenue of the Group was mainly derived from the sales of electricity. For the first half of 2017, the Group recorded a revenue of RMB9,144,490,000, representing a decrease of 9.83% as compared with RMB10,141,152,000 of the corresponding period last year. The decrease in revenue was mainly attributable to the fall in hydropower revenue by RMB1,034,840,000 which was the combined result of decreased electricity sales and reduced average on-grid tariff of hydropower by 23.28% and 6.74% respectively compared with the corresponding period last year. The reportable segments identified by the Group meeting the quantitative thresholds required by Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard (“HKFRS”) 8 are now the “generation and sales of coal-fired electricity”, “generation and sales of hydropower electricity” and “generation and sales of wind and photovoltaic power electricity”. Operating costs of the Group mainly consist of fuel costs for coal-fired power generation, repairs and maintenance expenses for power generating units and facilities, depreciation and amortization, staff costs, consumables and other operating expenses. For the first half of 2017, the operating costs of the Group amounted to RMB7,695,988,000, representing a rise of 16.89% as compared with RMB6,583,965,000 of the corresponding period last year. The increase in operating costs was mainly driven by the significant surge in fuel costs which was the result of rapidly rising coal prices as compared to the corresponding period last year. In the Group’s efforts to control costs, operating costs other than fuel costs and depreciation fell substantially, partly offsetting some negative effects of the increase in fuel costs. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 For the first half of 2017, the Group’s operating profit was RMB1,680,338,000, representing a decrease of 56.53% as compared with RMB3,865,262,000 of the corresponding period last year. The decrease in operating profit was the aggregated results of the surge in fuel costs and the fall in electricity sales and the reduced average on-grid tariff of hydropower. For the first half of 2017, the finance costs of the Group amounted to RMB943,613,000, representing a decrease of 12.68% as compared with RMB1,080,692,000 of the corresponding period last year. The Group’s continuous efforts to replace high-interest rate debts and monitor over the debt’s interest rates level, the finance costs decreased notwithstanding the average debts level increased over the same period last year. For the first half of 2017, the share of profits of associates was RMB136,546,000, representing a decrease in profits of RMB188,977,000 or 58.05% as compared with RMB325,523,000 of the corresponding period last year. The decrease in profits was mainly attributable to the decrease in profit contribution from an associate, Changshu Power Plant (principally engaged in coal-fired power generation and heat supply). For the first half of 2017, the share of profits of joint ventures was RMB5,955,000, representing a significant decrease in profits of RMB85,116,000 or 93.46% as compared with RMB91,071,000 of the corresponding period last year. The decrease in profits was mainly attributable to the significant decrease in profit contribution from a joint venture, Xintang Power Plant (principally engaged in cogeneration of heat and power). For the first half of 2017, income tax expense of the Group was RMB165,512,000, representing a decrease of RMB434,845,000 as compared with RMB600,357,000 of the corresponding period last year. The decrease was mainly due to the decline in operating profit. For the first half of 2017, the basic and diluted earnings per share for profit attributable to owners of the Company were RMB0.06 (2016: RMB0.26) and RMB0.06 (2016: RMB0.26) respectively. The board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has resolved not to distribute any interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 As at 30 June 2017, the Group had no material contingent liabilities. The Group has implemented all-rounded risk management and has established a systematic, comprehensive risk management mechanism and internal control system. The Group has a Risk Management Committee which is accountable and responsible to the Board and to assist the Board in providing leadership, direction and oversight with regard to the overall risk appetite and tolerance and risk management framework of the Group, including risk policies, process and controls. The Group also has an internal audit department in place for execution and implementation of risk management measures. The Group is principally operating in Mainland China, with most transactions denominating in RMB. Apart from certain bank and other borrowings as well as certain cash and cash equivalents, most of the Group’s assets and liabilities were denominated in RMB. The Group held commercial notes denominated in USD and borrowings denominated in JPY and USD. The volatility of RMB, USD and JPY exchange rates increased the exchange rate risks of the Group, thus affecting its financial position and operating results. In order to manage exchange rate risks, the Group entered into two option contracts to sell RMB for USD with Bank of America at a fixed exchange rate with an aggregate amount of USD296,778,000 in 2015, to hedge against the foreign exchange rate risk brought by USD denominated commercial notes. In June 2017, the option contracts were terminated and the Group had realized an accumulated pre-tax gain of RMB56,167,000 when comparing the proceeds receivable of RMB197,924,000 on termination with the acquisition cost of RMB141,757,000. The Group will continue to focus on the exchange rate movements and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to avoid excessive exchange rate risks. As at 30 June 2017, the Group’s borrowings denominated in foreign currencies amounted to approximately RMB3,285,402,000 (31 December 2016: RMB2,520,170,000), of which the largest amount was USD commercial notes (equivalent to RMB1,537,789,000 (31 December 2016: RMB2,081,100,000)). With the Group’s efforts to strengthen its development of all kinds of power projects, funding adequacy is having an increasing impact on the Group’s operations and development. The funding market is affected by a number of factors such as the liquidity of the lending market and the economic environment, that in turn may also affect the efficiency and costs of the Group’s borrowing. The Group has always been capable of leveraging its access to Mainland China and overseas markets to optimize its financing sources, increase the credit facilities and lower its financing costs. Cost-saving and efficiency enhancement initiatives have been adopted in our business management to lower administrative and operating expenses. Management reports annually to the Board on the working capital budget for the year at the beginning of each year and estimates the required amount of annual credit facilities and facilities reserves to ensure that the Group has obtained adequate financial resources to support the continued operation and development of projects for the foreseeable future and reviews the situation regularly to make contingency measures. As at 30 June 2017, the Group had available unutilized facilities (from banks, a related party and short-term commercial paper) amounting to RMB23,558,856,000. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 The Group has always been placing a great emphasis on environmental protection from the perspective of sustainable development, vigorously promoting energy conservation and emission reduction, conscientiously fulfilling social responsibility and actively responding to global climate change. In positive response to the policy of “Action Plan of the Upgrade and Renovation for Coal-fired Units to Achieve Energy Saving and Emission Reduction (2014-2020) ( (2014- 2020 ))” issued by the PRC government, the Group continued to strengthen the environmental protection measures to its coal-fired power generating units, actively carried out the ultra-low-emission improvement works for power generating units, adopted the domestic advanced and mature technology to implement the ultra-low-emission improvement works and effectively control the emission of pollutants. As of 30 June 2017, the Group had sixteen coal-fired power generating units completed the ultra-low-emission improvement works. For the remaining coal-fired power generating units, we will also speed up the implementation of ultra- low-emission projects. For the first half of 2017, the operational ratio of desulphurization facilities for the coal-fired power generating units of the Group was 100% (2016: 100%), and the efficiency ratio of desulphurization was 97.94% (2016: 96.39%); the operational ratio of denitration facilities reached 99.95% (2016: 99.90%) and the efficiency ratio of denitration reached 92.05% (2016: 83.37%).

The Group puts great emphasis on the establishment of performance evaluation as well as rewarding and punishment mechanism. The Group determines the emoluments of its directors and employees based on their respective performance, working experience, duties and the prevailing market rates. The Group also implements incentive policies linking emoluments with performance. China Power International Development Limited Interim Report 2017 The Group also focuses on the training of employees and communication between employees of different positions. It continues to improve the professional and technical skills and overall competence of its employees to satisfy the needs of its expanding businesses. In the first half of 2017, the national total electricity consumption extended the trend of accelerated growth arisen since the second half of 2016. According to the forecast from China Electricity Council, the national total electricity consumption for the full year will increase by about 5% when compared with last year, the growth in electricity demand for the second half of the year will be stable in general and the national electricity supply capacity is sufficient in general. In the second half of the year, the Group will strive to increase both power generation volume and marginal revenue. For electricity sales, total electricity sold in aggregate since June and July this year recorded considerable growth when compared with the corresponding period last year, particularly for coal-fired power. The Group will continue to strengthen analysis on electricity market policies and trend, adjust the power distribution and formulate effective marketing strategies, expand the market share in direct power supply actively at reasonable prices, and increase the utilization hours of facilities. In the aspect of on-grid tariffs, the National Development and Reform Commission issued a document in June 2017 and decided to cancel or reduce some of the governmental funds and surcharges with effect from 1 July, make reasonable adjustments to the structure of tariffs and increase the benchmark on-grid tariffs of coal-fired power plants. As at the date of this report, the Group has received tariff adjustment notices from a number of provinces, the benchmark on-grid tariffs of the Group’s coal-fired power plants will be adjusted upward in the second half of the year, which is favourable to enhance the Group’s profitability. In the aspect of fuel costs, it is expected that the State will further increase policy control efforts on the coal market in the second half of 2017. National production capacity of quality coal will be further released, the overall coal supply and demand will remain in a balanced state. There will be room for further reduction in coal prices despite with fluctuations. The Group will continue to strengthen tracking changes in the coal market, to improve coal purchasing, distribution and inventory management, to ensure coal supply under medium to long term contracts, and to suppress and reduce fuel costs with full efforts. For the second half of 2017, the Group will continue to accelerate transformation and development, devote significant efforts to develop clean energy, further proceed with the development of integrated energy projects, control and slow down coal-fired power investments and provide reasonable planning for capital expenditure. In addition, the Group will continue to leverage on the sustained and solid support from State Power Investment Corporation* (“SPIC”), to accelerate and facilitate the injection of quality clean energy assets in order to enlarge the Group’s assets and business coverage, and enhance its overall market competitiveness.

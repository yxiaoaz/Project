In the fi rst half of 2017, the global economy recovered slowly and maintained a low growth rate. Although oil price has slightly recovered as compared with the same period last year, the overall expenditure of oil and gas industry rebounded slightly, oil price was still facing frequent fl uctuation. According to information from third-parties such as IHS, the exploration and development expenditure for the upper stream worldwide, aft er experiencing sharp declines, will rebound 8.3% to US$379.0 billion in 2017. Regarding the world’s off shore exploration and development expenditure which has recorded a decrease of 27.9% in 2016 and will decrease further by 12.6% to US$104.0 billion in 2017, presenting a continuous downward trend. Th e recovery of off shore service market will be slower than that of the onshore service market. According to the forecast by Spears & Associates, the total market value for global oilfi eld services in 2017 amounted to US$257.3 billion, representing an increase of 17% as compared with the same period last year. Th e overall oilfi eld services industry will experience an upturn.

At the same time, the Group continued to consider controlling costs as its key focus area for internal control and further reduced the cost by optimizing procurement, speeding up industrialization of proprietory product technology, encouraging self-repair and maintenance and purchasing more domestic equipment and facilities. As a result of strenuous eff orts, the workload of certain service lines of jack-up and semi-submersible drilling rigs, marine support and well service and the service prices of a number of business lines had been adjusted in the fi rst half year, which improved the overall operating condition of the Group. In the fi rst half of 2017, the revenue of the Group amounted to RMB7,095.9 million, representing an increase of RMB133.3 million as compared with the same period last year.

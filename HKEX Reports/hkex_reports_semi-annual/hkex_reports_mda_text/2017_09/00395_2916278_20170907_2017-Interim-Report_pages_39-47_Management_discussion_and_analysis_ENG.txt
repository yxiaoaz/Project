During the period under review, the Group continued to utilize its technical strength and experience in software development and provision of O2O solutions through design, construction, maintenance and operation of Wi-Fi network to a variety of business customers. Business Review (Continued) The Group continued to deliver O2O services to various clients such as shopping malls, retail shops and exhibition centres by providing social customer relationship management platforms, big data management and maintenance service for effective implementation of more targeted promotion and marketing activities to improve business performance. The Group also helped the clients to analyse customers’ consumption habits from the data captured in the social customer relationship management platforms so as to help its clients to design more effective marketing strategy to attract customers in order to drive sales. Besides, the Group also provided maintenance services for the voice recording system, call center system and social customer relationship management platforms in the period. The Group continued to provide free Wi-Fi access to users in major business areas in Shanghai and in the designated stores of Tianjin China Resources Vanguard Limited. Besides, the Group also continued to develop the WeChat payment business in Hong Kong to provide services for retail and catering businesses in the application and technological docking for WeChat payment service and application for WeChat public accounts during the period. However, due to high operating costs and low revenue generated, the Group has terminated the Wi-Fi operations for railways under Guangzhou Railway (Group) Corporation, Beijing Railway Administration and Lanzhou Railway Administration in late of June 2017. For the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group’s revenue was approximately RMB8,828,000, a 21.6% decline from the same period of last year. The decrease was mainly due to the drop of revenue in O2O solutions segment upon disposal of non-wholly owned subsidiaries in the O2O solutions segment in November 2016 and January 2017. Hardware, telecom and direct operation costs consisted of hardware cost, software cost, installation cost, telecom operation cost, advertising and promotion cost and other direct costs incurred for O2O solutions segment and IDM solutions segment. The amount increased by 7.3% to RMB4,860,000 from the same period of last year mainly due to the full period effect of the service cost paid for Shanghai Wi-Fi operations and system development cost of WeChat payment platform in the current period. Employee benefits expenses decreased by 13.9% to RMB15,798,000 from the same period of last year mainly due to drop of headcounts upon disposal of non-wholly owned subsidiaries in the O2O solutions segment and termination of railway Wi-Fi operations in the IDM solutions segment. Financial Review (Continued) Other operating expenses mainly represented auditor’s remuneration, legal and professional fee, business development costs, office rental expenses, travelling expenses and other office expenses. The amount dropped by 9.3% to RMB9,207,000 from the same period of last year was mainly due to decrease in travelling expenses and office expenses with effective cost control imposed by the Group in the current period. Provision for onerous contracts of RMB50,575,000 made for the year ended 31 December 2016 represented the commitment for the long-term prepayments regarding the operation of wireless network at railway stations in the IDM solutions segment for the forthcoming years. Upon the signing of termination agreements by the Group in late of June 2017 to terminate the Wi-Fi operations for railways under Guangzhou Railway (Group) Corporation, Beijing Railway Administration and Lanzhou Railway Administration, the commitment was released and therefore the provision was reversed in the current period. Income tax expense of RMB2,054,000 represented deferred tax expense recognised for the current period. The balance increased significantly from the same period of last year due to the effect of increase in EIT rate of SZYL from 15% to 25% in the current period as SZYL was no longer entitled to enjoy an income tax concession at preferential rate of 15%. Financial Review (Continued) Property, plant and equipment decreased by 12.2% to RMB9,420,000 from 31 December 2016 mainly due to depreciation expenses incurred with no significant additions or disposals in the current period. Intangible assets represented software development costs for the self-developed software of O2O solutions segment. The balance declined by 20.6% to RMB30,911,000 from 31 December 2016 mainly due to amortisation expenses of RMB4,884,000 and write-off of intangible assets of RMB3,125,000 in the current period. Trade and other receivables increased by RMB19,269,000 from RMB27,180,000 as at 31 December 2016 to RMB46,449,000 as at 30 June 2017 mainly because of earnest money of approximately RMB21,752,000 (equivalent to HK$25,000,000) paid for the Proposed Acquisition upon signing of memorandum of understanding by the Company with a vendor on 10 June 2017. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to provide tailor-made solutions to customers’ Wi-Fi systems. Leveraging on the scene-based business intelligence developed by the Group and the integration of big data and cloud computing technologies, the Group is advancing towards the target of becoming the leader in provision of integrated solutions and platform in the O2O and big data market. Besides, The Group will continue to actively explore strategic opportunities to expand its business through various means such as technological cooperation, joint ventures and merger and acquisition. As at 30 June 2017, the Group’s bank and cash balances were approximately RMB67,197,000 (31 December 2016: approximately RMB99,953,000) and bank loans were RMB17,500,000 (31 December 2016: RMB15,000,000).

The bank loans were secured by charge over the land, building, investment properties and personal guarantee provided by a director of the Company. Liquidity and financial resources (Continued) As disclosed in 2016 annual report, the Company had completed the placing of 793,672,000 ordinary shares on 15 December 2016 which generated a net proceed of approximately RMB72,193,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$80,750,000), which was mainly used as general working capital for existing business and for investment of new business in the upstream and downstream of the Group’s principal business if opportunities arise. As at 30 June 2017, the aforesaid net proceed has been applied as follows: Intended use Actual use (i) General working capital for (for both (i) and (ii)) ((i) (ii) ) (ii) Investment of new business in the upstream and downstream of the Group’s principal business (iii) Unutilised balance The above mentioned uses are consistent with the intended use of proceeds as disclosed in 2016 annual report. The Group will constantly evaluate its business plan and may change or modify plan against the changing market condition to attain sustainable business growth of the Group. All the unutilised balances have been placed in licensed banks in Hong Kong and the PRC. The unutilised balances will be applied by the Company for the Proposed Acquisition (should the Proposed Acquisition materialized) and for general working capital of the existing business. Liquidity and financial resources (Continued) The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt-to-adjusted capital ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by adjusted capital. Net debt is calculated as total debts less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted capital comprises all components of equity attributable to the owners of the Company. As at 30 June 2017, since the cash and cash equivalents was over total debts, the net debt-to-adjusted capital ratio was not applicable (31 December 2016: 2.52%). It is the Group’s strategy to keep the net debt-to-adjusted capital ratio as low as feasible. As at 30 June 2017 the Group had a total of approximately 82 employees (As at 30 June 2016: approximately 198 employees). Employee benefits expenses (including directors’ emoluments) for the period were approximately RMB15,798,000 (30 June 2016: approximately RMB18,348,000).

Major subsidiaries of the Group operate in the PRC and most of the transactions are denominated in RMB. As certain of the Group’s monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in Hong Kong dollars (“HK$”), United States dollars (“US$”) and Korean won (“KRW”), any significant exchange rate fluctuations of HK$, US$, and KRW against RMB may have financial impacts to the Group.

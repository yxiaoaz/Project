In the first half of 2017, the international economic conditions remained challenging. The gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth rate of the United States (the “US”) was less than 2% for the first half of 2017. The economic outlook for the rest of the developed countries remains uncertain. Despite some European countries witnessed some signs of economic recovery, the GDP growth rate of the 28 countries in the European Union was less than 1% in the first half of 2017. Despite sluggish overseas demand, domestic over capacity and the adjustments resulting from the transition of the economy, the growth of the economy of the PRC remains stable. The GDP growth rate of the PRC slightly increased from a rate of 6.7% for the full year of 2016 to 6.9% in the first half of 2017. After the slump in the international oil prices to below US$30 per barrel in February 2016, oil prices have rebounded since the second quarter of 2016 and have been trading at above US$50 per barrel for most of the time in the first half of 2017. Stabilisation in prices of oil related raw materials translated into more stable market conditions for polyester yarns products. Domestic cotton prices in the PRC have shown an upward trend since the second half of 2016. In the first half of 2017, domestic cotton prices have stabilised and have been trading at over RMB15,500 per tonne for most of the time in the first half of 2017 without showing very large fluctuations. However, the price gap between imported cotton and domestic cotton has been hovering at around RMB2,000 per tonne and this continues to create a competitive disadvantage for the domestic cotton yarn manufacturers with few or no import quotas. Despite a relatively more stable environment in terms of the prices of the raw materials, the overall market conditions for the textile industry remains difficult due to a number of unfavourable factors including: poor overseas demand, weakened domestic demand resulting from a slow down domestic economy in the PRC, keen domestic competition in the PRC due to excess capacities and competition from manufacturing establishments in the South East Asia. The sales volume of yarn products of China Weaving Materials Holdings Limited (the “Company”) together with its subsidiaries, (the “Group”) decreased by 4.2% from approximately 56,934 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately 54,516 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The production volume of yarn products of the Group increased by 5.0% from approximately 55,477 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately 58,248 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The revenue of the yarn products of the Group increased by 10.3% to approximately RMB693.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as compared to RMB629.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

In the first half of 2017, the Group has continued to rationalise its production capacities and further diversified its product portfolio. The Group is offering around 100 types of yarn products with different material mix and counts to satisfy the needs of different customers. The Group’s subsidiary company, Jiangxi Xinyuan Special Fibres Company Limited (“Xinyuan”) has commenced trial production in November 2016. Xinyuan is engaged in the manufacture and trading of polyester staple fibres (“PSF”) which are one of the basic raw materials of the Group for the production of polyester yarns. The sales and production volume of PSF for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately 4,185 tonnes and 8,380 tonnes respectively. In August 2016, the Company issued redeemable fixed coupon notes with a principal amount of HK$50,000,000 (the “Notes”) and a redeemable fixed coupon convertible bond in the principal amount of HK$110,000,000 (the “Bond”) to CCB International Overseas Limited. The Company has early redeemed the Notes in full in March 2017. The Bond remained outstanding as at 30 June 2017. Revenue of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately RMB706.4 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB75.1 million, or 11.9%, as compared to the corresponding period last year. The analysis of the sales of the Group’s products is as below: Six months ended 30 June 2017 Six months ended 30 June 2016 The increase in the revenue of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was mainly attributable to the increase in the average selling price of yarn products of the Group of 15.2% from approximately RMB11,049 per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately RMB12,724 per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017, despite sales volume decreased by approximately 4.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as compared with the corresponding period in 2016. Gross profit of the Group increased from approximately RMB53.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately RMB62.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The gross profit margin of the Group slightly increased from approximately 8.5% for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately 8.8% for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increase in sales. The increase in sales was mainly due to the substantial increase in the average selling prices of the yarn products of the Group. The increase in the selling prices of the yarn products of the Group were mainly due to the higher prices of raw material in the first half of 2017 as compared with that of the corresponding period in 2016. The selling prices of yarn products generally have a positive correlation with that of raw materials. Other income of the Group increased from approximately RMB5.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to approximately RMB11.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017, representing an increase of approximately RMB5.8 million or 103.6%. The increase in other income was mainly due to increase in income from scrap sales and government grants. Other gains for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately RMB16.6 million while other gains for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was approximately RMB0.5 million. Other gains for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were mainly due to fair value gain on the derivative component of the Bond of approximately RMB14.5 million and net foreign exchange gain of RMB3.6 million. Those gains were partly offset by the unrealised loss on currency forward contracts of RMB1.3 million. Distribution and selling expenses of the Group remained about approximately the same at approximately RMB11.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as compared to approximately RMB11.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Distribution and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue of the Group was approximately 1.7% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (six months ended 30 June 2016: 1.8%).

The increase in administrative expenses was mainly due to administrative expenses attributable to Xinyuan which commenced production in November 2016.

The increase in the Group’s finance costs was mainly due to increase in interest on the Bond and the Notes, partially offset by decrease in interest on bond payables. The Group’s effective income tax rate for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately 18.9%, as compared to 63.6% for the corresponding period in 2016. The decrease in effective income tax rate was mainly due to the reversal of recognised deferred tax assets in respect of the tax loss carrying forward for the for the six months ended 30 June 2016 and the absence of such reversal for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Profit attributable to owners of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately RMB22.3 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB20.8 million, or 14 times, as compared to that for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

The increases in the Group’s net profit were mainly due to the increase in gross profit, other income and other gains, partially offset by increase in administrative expenses and finance costs. The basic earnings per share of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was approximately RMB1.78 cents, representing an increase of approximately 14 times as compared with approximately RMB0.12 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

No share option has been granted pursuant to the scheme since its adoption. During the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group did not have any significant investments or acquisitions or sales of subsidiaries. Despite a relatively more stable environment in terms of the prices of the raw materials, the overall market conditions for the textile industry remains difficult due to a number of unfavourable factors including: poor overseas demand, weakened domestic demand resulting from a slow down domestic economy in the PRC, keen domestic competition in the PRC due to excess capacities and competition from manufacturing establishments in the South East Asia. In the first half of 2017, the Group has continued to rationalise its production capacities and further diversified its product portfolio. The Group is offering around 100 types of yarn products with different material mix and counts to satisfy the needs of different customers. The Group has begun its upward vertical integration by establishing Xinyuan, which is engaged in the manufacturing of PSF. Xinyuan has commenced trial production in November 2016. Looking forward, unfavourable market conditions will continue to pose challenges to the textile industry in the PRC. The Group will continue to put more effort into new products development and increase its effort in developing markets for its new products. Taking into account the benefits from the enlarged product portfolio and the economies of scale, the Group is confident about its future. The Group believes it is well positioned to take advantage of any positive outlook in the textile industry given its scale of production, strong brand recognition and professional management.

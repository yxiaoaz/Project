I. Xiwang Special Steel Company Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) is a leading high-end special steel manufacturer located in Shandong Province of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”). Founded in 2003, the Group was listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) on 23 February 2012. Our production base is located in Xiwang Industrial Area, Zouping County, Shandong Province of China. We operate an integrated production process from iron smelting and steel smelting to secondary metallurgy, continuous casting and steel rolling. Our products consist of ordinary steel that is primarily used in buildings and infrastructures, as well as special steel that is used in automobile, shipbuilding, chemical and petrochemical, machinery and equipment sectors. Currently, the Group has an aggregate designed annual smelting capacity of electric arc furnaces (“EAFs”) and converters of approximately 3.3 million tonnes, and an aggregate designed annual rolling capacity of 3.0 million tonnes. The total designed annual capacity of our blast furnaces and sintering furnaces are 2.1 million tonnes and 3.7 million tonnes, respectively. The Group possesses two production flows, which are (1) steel scraps as raw materials for steel production through EAFs; (2) sintering furnace turning iron ores into sinter for blast furnaces to produce molten iron which was then converted into steel by converters. This provides us with more flexibility in production flow, as we could control our cost and product mix through the utilization of different raw materials. Our steel production facilities, as of 30 June 2014, consisted of: a sintering furnace, with a designed annual capacity of 3.7 million tonnes, supplies sinter for the two blast furnaces; two blast furnaces, with a designed annual capacity of 1.05 million tonnes each, use iron ore to convert sinter into molten iron and pig iron for production purposes of the EAFs and converters; two converters, i.e. Converter I and Converter II, with a designed annual capacity of 1.15 million tonnes each, convert raw materials including steel scraps, molten iron and pig iron into molten steel and then cast into ordinary steel billets and special steel billets; two EAFs, i.e. EAF I and EAF II, with a designed annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes each. The two EAFs convert raw materials, including steel scraps, molten iron and pig iron into molten steel and then cast into ordinary steel billets and special steel billets. The ordinary steel billets are rolled into ordinary steel products of rebars and wire rods. The special steel billets are rolled into special steel products, which include quality carbon structural steel, alloy structural steel and bearing steel; two bar rolling lines, Bar I and Bar II, with a designed annual capacity of 850,000 tonnes each upon the addition of equipment and improvement of technology for the six months ended 30 June 2014 (the “Period”). Bar I and Bar II manufacture small to medium-sized steel bars, including rebars, quality carbon structural steel and alloy structural steel; a large bar rolling line, Bar III, with a designed annual capacity of 650,000 tonnes upon the addition of equipment and improvement of technology during the Period. Bar III manufactures large bar of special steel products including quality carbon structural steel, a wire rolling line with a designed annual capacity of 650,000 tonnes upon the addition of equipment and improvement of technology during the Period. This wire rolling line manufactures steel products in the form of wire rod, which include wire rod, quality carbon structural steel and bearing steel. The Group produced and sold ordinary steel and special steel and mainly traded raw materials, such as iron ore dust and pellet, during the Period. Ordinary steel mainly includes rebar and wire rod. Special steel includes quality carbon structural steel, alloy structural steel and bearing steel. Details are as follows: Rebar is mainly used in building construction and infrastructure projects. Our rebar has cross sectional diameters ranging from 12 millimetres to 32 millimetres. We produce ribbed and plain wire rods, both of which have cross sectional diameters ranging from 6 millimetres to 12 millimetres. Our wire rod is used to make coil, spring, electronic and precise machinery parts. Our quality carbon structural steel includes steel billets with cross sectional diameters ranging from 160 millimetres to 250 millimetres, steel bars and steel wires with cross sectional diameters ranging from 6.5 millimetres to 60 millimetres. Quality carbon structural steel contains less than 0.8% carbon and has less sulfur, phosphorus and non-metallic contents than ordinary carbon structural steel. Because of its higher purity, quality carbon structural steel has better mechanical properties, such as yield strength and tensile strength, than ordinary carbon structural steel. This product is mainly used for buildings and infrastructures. Alloy structural steel is mostly used in machineries. In order to get the desired steel properties, manganese, silicon, nickel, chromium and molybdenum were added to adjust the chemical composition. Our alloy structural steel includes steel billets with cross sectional diameters ranging from 160 millimetres to 250 millimetres, and steel bars with cross sectional diameters ranging from 22 millimetres to 60 millimetres. We produce bearing steel bars and wires with cross sectional diameters ranging from 5.5 millimetres to 60 millimetres. They are used in manufacturing rollers or ball bearings for automobile industry. Our bearing steel products are of relatively high level of purity and thus are harder in structure than ordinary steel. II. Revenue of the Group was RMB4,696,743,000 during the Period (first half of 2013: RMB3,596,340,000), representing an increase of 30.6% as compared to the corresponding period of last year. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the significant growth of commodities trading business during the Period. Sales of commodities trading business amounted to RMB938,645,000, accounting for 20.0% of the total revenue. Moreover, we expanded our production capacity during the Period, and the sales volume of steel amounted to 1,232,806 tonnes (first half of 2013: 1,071,628 tonnes), representing an increase of 161,178 tonnes or 15.0% as compared with the corresponding period of last year. However, revenue derived from production and sales of steel increased from RMB3,530,960,000 in the corresponding period of last year to RMB3,653,648,000 for the Period, representing an increase of only RMB122,688,000 or 3.5%. The mild growth in revenue was mainly due to the drop of selling price of steel, with the selling price of special steel experiencing a more significant decline than that of ordinary steel in general. The decrease in the selling price of steel was resulted from keen market competition and lower raw material price. Due to the increase in production volume, revenue of by- products increased to RMB104,450,000 for the Period (first half of 2013: RMB65,380,000), representing an increase of 59.8% as compared to the corresponding period of last year. During the Period, the distribution of the sales of steel of the Group by regions was similar to that in the corresponding period of last year. Proportion of sales in Shandong province continued to increase and accounted for 75.1% during the Period (first half of 2013: 63.9%). Breakdown of revenue: Production and sales of Trading of commodities# Sales of by-products## Trading of commodities mainly includes the trading of iron ore dust, pellet, steel billets and coke.

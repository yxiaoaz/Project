We are a leading stainless steel processing service provider in China which provides processing services to customers across different industries. We have a network of five processing centres situated in Wuxi, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Tianjin and Taiyuan providing coil cutting, surface polishing, plate cutting, forming, machining, flat bar processing, precision sheet metal processing and welding services to over 10,000 active customers. The sixth processing centre is now under construction in Jingjiang, Jiangsu province. The market price of stainless steel materials rose steadily from January 2014 to May 2014 and the Group was able to capture a significant increase in operating profit consequently. There was a significant drop in the market price of stainless steel materials in June 2014 and a provision for write- down of inventories was also recorded. In order to widen our business scope, the Group had commenced its carbon steel processing services in March 2013. Carbon steel has high demands in a wide variety of industrial use including building infrastructures, containers and machineries and it has a lower unit price as compared with stainless steel. Developing into processing services of carbon steel will open more business opportunities to the Group. Carbon steel processing services are being provided by our Wuxi processing centre and Hangzhou processing centre currently. The current sales volume and processing volume of our carbon steel processing services reach over 30,000 tonnes per month. The construction of the sixth phase of our Wuxi processing centre is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 which will become our precision sheet metal processing centre. The precision sheet metal processing p l a t f o r m w i l l s e r v e c u s t o m e r s mainly in the motor vehicles, health, environmental protection, weaving and electrical industries. The construction of the new Wuhan processing centre was substantially completed and installation of new machineries was started in May 2014. The machineries in the original Wuhan processing centre had also been relocated to the new processing centre in May 2014. On 28 April, 2014, the Group entered into an equity transfer agreement with Baosteel Stainless Steel Co., Ltd. (“Baosteel”) pursuant to which the Group agreed to transfer 5% interest in Hangzhou Wanzhou Metal Products Co., Ltd at a consideration of RMB11,170,000. Baosteel is a key supplier of the Group and the entering into the equity transfer agreement will strengthen the Group’s strategic alliance with Baosteel. The building infrastructure of the Taiyuan processing centre was substantially completed and is under trial run currently. Equipped with coil and plate cutting, precision shearing and slitting, surface polishing and forming platforms, Taiyuan processing centre will provide processing services to both our stainless steel and carbon steel customers. With the experience in the processing service for mobile phones by using the flat bar processing platform, the Group received an order for the provision of stainless steel material and cutting service from the manufacturer of “Xiaomi 4” in July 2014. The Group will proceed with the completion of the processing centres in Wuhan, Taiyuan and Jingjiang in the second half year of 2014. We shall also devote more resources to our carbon steel processing business in order to provide a more comprehensive service to our customers. The construction of the Jingjiang processing centre in Jingjiang, Jiangsu province was substantially completed and installation of machineries was started in July 2014. The Jingjiang processing centre will provide processing services to our customers mainly involved in heavy industries such as pressurized container manufacturers and infrastructural parts manufacturers.

Our revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2014 amounted to approximately RMB8,582 million comprising approximately RMB7,983 million from our stainless steel business and approximately RMB599 million from our carbon steel business. As compared with the revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2013 of approximately RMB6,793 million, it represented an increase of approximately 26.3%. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in the sales volume of both our stainless steel and carbon steel businesses. The sales volume of our stainless steel business increased from 421,242 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to 555,201 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2014 representing an increase of approximately 31.8%.

Gross profit increased from approximately RMB168.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to approximately RMB419.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 mainly due to the increase in sales volume and the increased demands in our deep processing services.

Other income increased from approximately RMB0.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to approximately RMB2.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 due to the receipt of compensation from various services providers. Distribution costs increased from approximately RMB46.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to approximately RMB65.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in staff costs and transportation costs as a result of the increase in sales volume. Administrative expenses increased from approximately RMB59.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to approximately RMB72.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014.

Finance costs increased from approximately RMB47.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 to approximately RMB54.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014.

The increase was mainly due to the increase in sales volume and processing volume of both our stainless steel and carbon steel processing services as well as the significant improvement in gross profit as a result of the steady increase in the market price of stainless steel materials during January 2014 to May 2014. The Group mainly operates in the PRC with most of the transactions denominated and settled in RMB. However, the Group has certain trade receivables, restricted bank balances, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, other payables and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, mainly United States Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar, which are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Our Group does not use any forward contract or other instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposure.

Bank acceptance notes amounted to approximately RMB1,820.9 million while the bank balances were approximately RMB846.8 million of which approximately RMB757.2 million were restricted bank deposits for issuing letter of credit and notes payable. As at 30 June 2014, the net current assets of the Group amounted to approximately RMB10.7 million as compared with approximately RMB1.8 million as at 31 December 2013. The low net current assets level was mainly due to the capital expenditures required for the expansion of business. The gearing ratios as at 30 June 2014 and 31 December 2013 were 44.33% and 44.05% respectively. The ratios are calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents while total capital is calculated as total equity plus net debt.

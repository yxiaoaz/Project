F&B industry is always a challenging industry with intense competitions and heavily dependent on the economic conditions of Hong Kong. Given the recent slowdown in the Hong Kong economy, we will adopt a prudent expansion strategy in opening one “Classified” restaurant and a central kitchen as well as carrying out renovation work on several restaurants at the end of this year.

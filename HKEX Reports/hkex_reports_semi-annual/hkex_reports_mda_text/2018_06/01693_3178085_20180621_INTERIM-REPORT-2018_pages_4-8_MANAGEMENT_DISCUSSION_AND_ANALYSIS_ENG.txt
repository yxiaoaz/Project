The board (“Board”) of directors (“Directors”) of BGMC International Limited (“Company”) is pleased to announce the unaudited consolidated results of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively “Group” or “BGMC”) for the six months ended 31 March 2018 (“1H2018”), together with the comparative figures for the six months ended 31 March 2017 (“1H2017”) and other relevant figures. Notwithstanding the decrease in recognition of revenue in 1H2018, the Construction Services sector continued to be BGMC’s main revenue contributor, contributing 98.2% or RM306.4 million in 1H2018 as compared to 98.5% or RM353.8 million recorded in 1H2017. The slight decrease in contribution was primarily because progress for most of the projects were still in early stage of completion in all the segments, namely Building and Structure, Earthwork and Infrastructure, Mechanical and Electrical, Energy Transmission and Distribution even though the Group managed to secure RM792.6 million of new contracts in the financial year ended 30 September 2017 while successfully adding nineteen (19) new projects worth RM244.5 million in contract value as of 1H2018. As at 31 March 2018, the BGMC’s order book for Construction Services sector stood at RM3.6 billion while its outstanding order book stood at RM1.1 billion. The BGMC’s ongoing projects are as follows: Contract D’Pristine Medini: Construction of a mixed development consisting of a 3-storey retail unit, 6-storey parking facilities, a 23-storey office tower, a 28-storey SOHO tower, a 29-storey SOHO tower and a 27-storey hotel tower at Medini Iskandar, Johor, Malaysia. The Sky Seputeh: Construction of two blocks of 37-storey towers consisting of 290 units of apartments, car parks and other facilities at Taman Seputeh, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia. Setia Spice: Construction of a 26-storey building which consists of a 19-storey hotel tower (453 rooms), a 3-storey carpark, 4-storey hotel facilities and a 2-storey basement carpark at Setia Spice, Bayan Lepas, Penang, Malaysia. The Serini: Construction of two blocks of 38-storey towers consisting of 528 units of apartments, car parks and other facilities at Melawati, Selangor, Malaysia. TNB Worker’s Quarters: Construction of one block of 8-storey executive quarters (24 units), three blocks of 9-storey non-executive quarters (160 units) and other facilities at Kuala Berang, Terengganu, Malaysia. V-Residency 5: Construction of a 24-storey tower consisting of apartments and other amenities at Selayang Town, Gombak District, Selangor, Malaysia. Melaka Power Plant: Building Works for the Construction of 2,422 megawatt (“mw”) Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (“CCGT”) Power Plant at Kuala Sungai Baru, Alor Gajah, Melaka, Malaysia. Leveraging on the amount of contracts of Building and Structures segment we had in hand, this segment was at the forefront of the Construction Services business component, contributing 73.6% or RM245.2 million during the 1H2018. For 1H2018, all the key projects were still in different stages of completion. Projects such as MSM Warehouse, the Serini Melawati and D’Pristine Medini are close to completion. Meanwhile, those that had started and progressed well are projects such as Sky Seputeh, Setia Spice and V-Residency 5. In the meantime, the Group had also started new projects like the Building Works for the Melaka 2,422mw CCGT Power Plant and the Tenaga Nasional Berhad (“TNB”) Worker’s Quarters. As at 31 March 2018, BGMC secured four (4) new contracts worth RM163.7 million for this segment such as the Building Works for the Melaka 2,422mw CCGT Power Plant and the TNB Worker’s Quarters. BGMC has an outstanding order book of RM799.9 million in this segment. Energy Transmission and For 1H2018, BGMC undertook Energy Transmission and Distribution works that involved the installation of 132 kilovolt (“kV”) underground cabling systems and the construction of a 275/132kV power substation. This segment has contributed 8.9% or RM29.5 million to BGMC in 1H2018 and it had recorded a healthy growth throughout this period. The increase was made possible with the construction of PMU 275/132kV Tanjung Langsat which is close to completion while the underground cabling works into PMU MRT Semantan from PMU Damansara City to PMU Brickfield have also made to an advance progress. With the award of another new contract of 132kV underground cabling installation work from PMU Sri Hartamas to PMU Matrade worth RM15.2 million, this segment had an outstanding order book of RM92.6 million as at 31 March 2018. During the 1H2018, the Mechanical and Electrical segment has contributed RM22.0 million to the revenue of BGMC. It experienced a decrease of 15.4% from RM26.0 million in 1H2017. The segment’s proportion to BGMC total revenue was recorded at 6.6% in 1H2018 compared to 6.8% in 1H2017. The decrease is because majority of the projects are still in an early stage of the progress. The segment has eighteen (18) ongoing projects. As of 31 March 2018, the segment managed to secure twelve (12) new contracts worth RM28.8 million in total and had retained healthy outstanding contracts worth RM160.7 million. The Earthwork and Infrastructure Works segment has recorded only RM9.6 million of revenue in 1H2018 or 2.9% of the total revenue. A low outstanding contract sum means that lower amount of construction activities were recorded in 1H2018. There were lower winning rates for the new tenders compared to 1H2017. Anyway, the segment has managed to secure a new contract in 1H2018 for an amount of RM36.0 million. The contract includes Earthworks, Soil Improvements Works, Instrumentation Works and its Associated Works at Kuala Langat. This new contract has boosted the outstanding order to RM48.5 million in total as of 31 March Concession and In 1H2018, the Concession segment recorded an imputed interest income of RM21.5 million compared to RM21.8 million in 1H2017. The Maintenance Services segment, on the other hand, contributed RM5.5 million to the overall revenue in 1H2018 beating the RM5.3 million recorded in 1H2017. The remaining period for our UiTM concession stands at 17 years and 8 months as of 31 March 2018. The outstanding imputed interest income for our Concession segment that is yet to be recognised is therefore calculated at RM853.8 million while the outstanding contract value for the Maintenance Services segment is now recorded at RM189.9 million. Leveraging on the experience and expertise in the Construction Services sector and the Concession and Maintenance Services sector, BGMC has managed to secure another concession project to construct and develop a large scale solar PV plant (“LSSPV Plant”) of 30 megawatt alternate current (“MWa.c.”) at Kuala Muda, Kedah, Malaysia. B G M C h a d m a d e v o l u n t a r y announcements in relation to the winning of the concession project on 12 December 2017, 28 March 2018 and 24 April 2018 respectively. BGMC successfully accepted the letter of award from the Energy Commission of Malaysia while having signed a 21- year power purchase agreement with TNB, the sole electricity distributor in Peninsular Malaysia. The commercial operation date of the LSSPV Plant is scheduled to be on 30 September The success of the UiTM BLMT project has helped elevate BGMC’s performance in the Concession and Maintenance Services sector and this in turn has enhanced the ability to secure more concessions in the future. In Malaysia, we foresee construction projects to increase, which will also increase the number of concession projects in transportation, road, communications, healthcare, energy and education sectors undertaken by the government of Malaysia. BGMC believes that it is working from a position of strength to capture the concession projects under the Private Finance Initiative (“PFI”) programme, which will widen its customer base and at the same time, strengthen its reputation in both Malaysia and the region’s construction landscape. Though with the slight drop in the performance during 1H2018, the future is still very promising for BGMC. As there is a strong replenishment of the order book and a high outstanding value in the order books of BGMC, we are confident that BGMC will have a bright prospect. With the newly won concession project to construct and develop a 30 MWa.c. LSSPV plant, it is foreseeable that the performance will improve for the next 24 to 36 months. Moving forward, BGMC will optimise productivity and replenish the order books accordingly in the next six (6) months, tender for new projects in the corporate sector, property (residential and commercial) sector, and industrial sector, government-linked projects, support infrastructure projects in Malaysia as well as seize opportunities available elsewhere in the Southeast Asia region. At the same time, BGMC is looking for possible opportunities via strategic partnerships to extend our portfolio and footprint across the region, thereby increasing our market share in the near future. BGMC’s strategy to create further income streams from the Construction Services sector as well as the Concession and Maintenance Services sector faced some headwinds in the 1H2018. BGMC experienced a decrease of 13.2% in revenue from RM359.1 million in 1H2017 to RM311.9 million in 1H2018. The overall decrease was mainly due to slower than expected progress of work in some of the newly awarded contracts. The following are the breakdown of each of the segments: The Building and Structure segment experienced a decrease in revenue of 8.4% from RM267.7 million in 1H2017 to RM245.2 million in 1H2018 due to delay in the kick- start of some of the newly awarded contracts, for example Sky Seputeh and Spice Hotel. The delay was due to the readiness and handing over of the construction site to the Company. The Energy Transmission and Distribution segment experienced an increase in revenue of 10.5% from RM26.7 million in 1H2017 to RM29.5 million in 1H2018. The higher income resulted from better stage of progress for power substation work at PMU 275/132kV Tanjung Langsat and underground cabling works of PMU MRT Semantan. The Mechanical and Electrical segment experienced a decrease in revenue of 15.4% from RM26.0 million in 1H2017 to RM22.0 million in 1H2018. Despite the progress of The Henge project being at a more advance progress stage, thus making a larger contribution to 1H2018, most of the other projects were still in the early stage of progress. While D’Pristine Medini project is nearing its completion, the progress is slower than expected. The Earthwork and Infrastructure segment experienced a decrease in revenue of 71.3% from RM33.4 million in 1H2017 to RM9.6 million in 1H2018. The sharp decrease was due to low outstanding contract sum and the failure to secure more similar contracts compared to 1H2017. The Concession and Maintenance Services segment experienced a slight decrease in revenue of 0.4% from RM27.1 million in 1H2017 to RM27.0 million in 1H2018. Gross profit reduced to RM44.8 million in 1H2018 from RM65.9 million in 1H2017 whilst the gross margin dropped to 14.4% for 1H2018 from 18.4% in 1H2017. The decreases in gross profit was mainly due to (i) the early stage of progress for most of the projects in hand; and (ii) our wait for the final account and claim settlement of the completed projects. Meanwhile, the reduction in gross margin is due to (i) the increase in the material cost of steel product for the ongoing projects; and (ii) the infant stage of some of the newly awarded contracts. Administrative and Other Administrative expenses increased from RM31.7 million for 1H2017 to RM37.1 million for 1H2018, mainly due to an increase in staff costs and depreciation. The increase in headcount from 383 as at 31 March 2017 to 431 as at 31 March 2018 contributed to a substantial increase in staff costs as more headcount was required for newly awarded contracts. Overall, the staff costs increased from RM13.5 million in 1H2017 to RM17.7 million in 1H2018. Higher depreciation charges of RM4.6 million were recorded in 1H2018 as compared to RM3.6 million recognised in 1H2017 due to the increase in the acquisition cost of construction machineries and equipment during the 1H2018. Appreciation of RM against Hong Kong Dollar (“HKD”) resulted in unrealised foreign exchange loss of RM1.1 million in 1H2018 (1H2017: Nil) arising from fixed deposits, cash and bank balances denominated in HKD currency. Finance costs increased from RM9.8 million in 1H2017 to RM10.9 million in 1H2018 due to a 25 basis points hike in Malaysia overnight policy rate (“OPR”) with effect from 25 January Effective income tax in 1H2018 was 33.2% compared with 32.1% as recorded in 1H2017. Profit Attributable to the Based on the above factors, profit attributable to the owners of the Company decreased by RM19.0 million or 58.4% from RM32.6 million in 1H2017 to RM13.6 million in 1H2018. Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capital The gearing ratio improved from 82.2% as at 30 September 2017 to 76.2% recorded as at 31 March 2018 mainly due to an increase in equity attributable to higher accumulated retained earnings and repayment of the term loan instalment for our UiTM BLMT project. Our cash and cash equivalents as at 31 March 2018 amounted to RM119.9 million compared to RM136.6 million recorded as at 30 September 2017 due to the increase in financing for newly secured projects. The Company’s financing and treasury activities are centrally managed and controlled at the corporate level. The Company’s bank borrowings are all denominated in RM and have been arranged on a floating-rate basis. It is the Company’s policy not to enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. As at 31 March 2018, our net current assets amounted to RM238.2 million compared to net current assets of RM241.6 million recorded as at 30 September 2017 due to a decrease in fixed deposits and bank balances to finance new projects. The Board regularly reviews the maturity analysis of the Group’s contractual liabilities and concluded that there is no liquidity issue that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our capital expenditures mainly consist of procurement of construction machineries such as tower cranes, concrete pumps and aluminium formworks, which were financed by hire purchase, the proceeds from the global offering and internally generated funds. For 1H2018, our acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounted to RM2.3 million which mainly comprised construction machineries and equipment. The functional currencies of our operations, assets and liabilities are mostly denominated in RM. Therefore, we are not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk, except for our HKD denominated fixed deposit and bank balances. No hedging financial instruments are employed yet to manage foreign exchange risk. The Group did not hold any significant investments during 1H2018. As at 31 March 2018, the Group had a work force of 431 employees compared with 383 employees as at 31 March 2017. Total staff costs incurred in 1H2018 were RM17.7 million as compared to RM13.5 million recorded in 1H2017. Remuneration is determined by reference to prevailing market terms and in accordance with the performance, qualification and experience of each individual employee.

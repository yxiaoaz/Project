The Company reported its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2019 with a loss attributable to the equity holders of the Company of RMB93,512,000, representing an increase of loss of RMB26,704,000 from loss of RMB66,808,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The Group’s revenue from continuing operations for the six months ended 30 June 2019 decreased by approximately 17.3% to RMB52,822,000. During the six months ended 30 June 2019, due to increased competition in traditional optical fiber deployment business, the Group adjusted its allocation of resources by taking the initiative to reduce the amount of business undertaken and foster new potential business growth drivers. The strategy adjustment leads to a decrease in revenue of design, deployment and maintenance services of optical fibers. The Group recorded a substantial loss attributable to the equity holders of the Company due to the following reasons, 1) fall in revenue as a result of strategy adjustment, 2) recognition of a non cash share-based payments costs of RMB20,205,000 lead to a significant increase in administrative expenses. The Group is principally engaged in the provision of design, deployment and maintenance services of optical fibers, the provision of other communication networks services, the provision of environmentally intelligent technical products and services and money lending services. Our competitive strengths on deployment optical fibers include (1) we provide flexible solutions to our clients with our microducts and mini-cable system integration methods; and (2) we have registered a number of patents and obtained the rights to use the drainage system in various cities/districts to enhance our business development in telecommunication industry in the PRC. Based on the experience of the Group and the results of detailed analysis, it has been shown that laying optical fiber cables through combining the use of drainage system and mini-cable and micro-ducts technology is a technology that can construct networks with the most extensive coverage in a shorter time and at a lower cost, and it is expected that no alternative technology with a lower cost will be available in the foreseeable future. In order to diversify and strengthen our revenue streams, the Group made strategic investments in other new business to maximise returns to the Company’s shareholders. In February 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of 51% of equity interest in Beijing Yourui Jiahe Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. (“Yourui”, ). Yourui is principally engaged in the provision of environmentally intelligent technical products and services in the PRC. The Directors are of the view that the acquisition of Yourui and the collaboration between Yourui and the Company will provide opportunities to the Company to diversify its existing business and broaden its revenue stream. During the six months ended 30 June 2019, a decrease in revenue of deployment services of optical fibers was mainly due to a significant decrease in deployment construction revenue in Hebei Province due to keen competition of the market. Provision of environmentally intelligent technical products and services is a new segment as a result of the acquisition of Yourui. Yourui positions itself as a high-tech company which provides clients with environmental protection related services and solutions based on big data analysis. The main business scope of Yourui covers environmental surveillance and data analysis, environmental early warning and emergency command system construction, environmental management projects as well as security video surveillance and related products. Except for optical fibers related services, the group also provides other integrated services relating to design, construction and maintenance of communication networks. The money lending segment principally earns interest income from loans to third parties. The Group has obtained a money lenders license in Hong Kong under the Money Lenders Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong). The business of low-voltage equipment integration services was disposed in December 2018. Looking forward, the Group expects the operating environment will continue to be challenging. However, the application of wireless technology by the market and the promotion of cloud computing, big data and data centres, together with upgrades in systems and skills and application of 4G and development of 5G, is expected to lead to a multi-fold increase in the global demand for bandwidth in the next few years. Optical fiber broadband network construction is the forerunner of all infrastructure, and the most important ring for the economic development of countries in the surrounding areas under the One Belt One Road initiative. Upgrade of existing networks and laying of new networks are required to cope with the local needs for future development. The Group is proactively looking for business opportunities to expand its existing business in the PRC and overseas. In order to cope with the anticipated challenges and staying competitive, more efforts will be made to strengthen internal control and management, strictly control production costs and operating expenses. The Group will also continue to explore any opportunities to diversify our business with the ultimate aim of bringing greater value to our shareholders in the long run. The Group’s revenue from continuing operations for the six months ended 30 June 2019 was RMB52,822,000, representing a decrease of approximately 17.3% over the corresponding period of the previous financial year. The decrease in the Group’s revenue from continuing operations was mainly due to decrease of construction contract revenue of deployment services of optical fibers. The following table sets out the breakdown of our Group’s revenue during the period: (Decrease) Revenue from the provision of design, deployment and maintenance (63.3) – Micro-ducts and mini-cables system (18.1) (49.3) Provision of environmentally intelligent (7.1) (17.3) Revenue from the installation and sales of low-voltage system equipment (100.0) (47.9) Revenue generated from our provision of design, deployment and maintenance of optical fibers services, was RMB21,292,000, representing approximately 40.3% of the total revenue from continuing operations of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2019. The decrease in construction revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2019 as compared to 2018 was mainly due to the decrease in the revenue derived from the provision of deployment services of optical fibers in Hebei Province due to keen competition. The following table set forth our revenue from construction contract by major locations for the period indicated. Revenue from the provision of environmentally intelligent technical products and services was RMB17,478,000, representing approximately 33.1% of the total revenue from continuing operations of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2019.

The decrease in the Group’s cost of sales was due to decrease of construction costs for deployment services of optical fibers and cost control. Gross profit/(loss) The following table sets forth the gross profit/(loss) of each of our services for the period indicated: Revenue from the provision of design, deployment and maintenance (80.6) – Micro-ducts and mini-cables (63.3) Provision of environmentally intelligent Revenue from the installation and sales of low-voltage system equipment The following table sets forth the gross margin of each of our services for the period indicated: Increase/ (Decrease) Revenue from the provision of design, deployment (113.6) (114.3) – Micro-ducts and mini-cables system (44.8) (48.3) Revenue from environmentally intelligent Revenue from the installation and sales of low-voltage system equipment (11.6) There was an increase in overall gross margin from continuing operations for the six months ended 30 June 2019 as compared with the corresponding period of the previous financial year. The increase in our gross margin was mainly a net effect of the increase in gross profit margin of our new business, provision of environmentally intelligent technical products and services and the decrease in the gross margin of design, deployment and maintenance of optical fibers services during the period. The reason for the gross loss margin of deployment of optical fibers services is due to keen competition. Sales of goods and provision of services to the Group’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 71.7% of the total sales of goods and provision of services for the six months ended 30 June 2019.

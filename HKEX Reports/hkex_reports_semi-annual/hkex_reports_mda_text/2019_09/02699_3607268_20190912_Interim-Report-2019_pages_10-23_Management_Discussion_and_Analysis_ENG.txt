In the first half of 2019, China’s economic situation was stable, with GDP increasing by 6.3% year- on-year. The tightening policies in China over the months in the first half of 2019 were characterized by a more lenient start and turned tougher in the latter period. The PRC government tightened the regulation of real estate funds and as a consequence, trust financing was seriously affected. The project financing environment was difficult. The overall policy in the first quarter of 2019 boosted the market’s expectations. However, the degree of tightening has been significantly strengthened since April 2019. In particular, Xi’an and Suzhou, which were more robust in property transaction recently, had tightened their purchase-and-sale restriction policies respectively, and became the gauge of determining the degree of macro-adjustment measures at the current stage. At the same time, the interest rate hikes in some cities in China started to intensify, and Hefei, Suzhou, Dongguan and other places also timely tightened the land auction policy due to the booming of the respective real estate markets, together with the reaction to the proposed “one policy for one city” by Henan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Chengdu, Changsha, Wuhan and other provinces and cities in the first half of 2019, all these phenomena adequately reflected that the regulatory policies were kept closely in line with market changes and tightened when the circumstances required. Moreover, due to the increase in supply of commercial properties in various cities in China in the first quarter of 2019, sales of commercial properties in first-tier and second-tier cities showed a decline to different extents; while the number of commercial property development projects continued to shrink during the period, down 39.6% year-on-year. For the above reasons, sales of the Group’s commercial and residential housing during the Period were adversely affected. During the Period, the Group recorded a total revenue of approximately RMB103.9 million, representing a decrease of approximately 58.1% from approximately RMB248.2 million for the corresponding period last year. Sales of delivered properties and GFA were approximately RMB73.1 million and approximately 9,613.94 sq.m., representing respective decreases of 67.4% and 74.3% year-on-year. The average selling price for the contracted sales was approximately RMB7,601 per sq.m., representing an increase of approximately 26.8% compared with approximately RMB5,995 for the corresponding period last year. The price of commodity housing in Shanghai rose steadily in general, which drove up the average sales price. In contrast, the average selling price of Chongqing Xinming • China South-western City Phase 1 dropped approximately 69.9%, as the selling price of the apartments in Block 4 was lower than the selling price of the shops in Block 3 and Block 6 last year. Loss attributable to the shareholders for the Period amounted to approximately RMB6.5 million, representing a decrease of 68.3% from a loss of approximately RMB20.5 million for the corresponding period last year. The decreased loss was mainly attributable to gains from the decrease of fair value of convertible bonds of approximately RMB18.2 million and the appreciation of investment properties of approximately RMB32.4 million. The basic loss per share was RMB0.003. The Directors did not recommend the payment of an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June As of 30 June 2019, the Group’s total assets amounted to approximately RMB6,705.8 million (31 December 2018: approximately RMB6,772.2 million).

During the Period, the Group recorded a total revenue of approximately RMB103.9 million, representing an approximate 58.1% decrease from approximately RMB248.2 million for the corresponding period last year. During the Period, the Group recorded property sales revenue of approximately RMB73.1 million, representing 70.3% of its total revenue. Total delivered GFA was approximately 9,613.94 sq.m., representing a decrease of approximately 74.3% compared to the same period of last year. This was mainly due to (i) continued sales of the remaining shops in the Hangzhou Project; (ii) sales of delivered properties and GFA of the Shanghai Project decreased by approximately 89.0% and 91.4% respectively compared with the corresponding period last year due to personnel changes in the sales team, and the prolonged influence of property governance policies for optimisation and rectification imposed by the Shanghai Municipal Government; (iii) slowing sales after a failure to promote the Chongqing Project as originally planned, as a result of negotiations with the government on an overall strategy for comprehensive adjustment of land use; (iv) recovery of apartment and shops sales for the Shandong Project. Income from the Shandong Project during the first half of the year mainly derived from rebounding sales in the housing market, representing an increase of 8.1 times compared to the same period of last year; (v) recovering and increasing sales of the retail spaces in the Taizhou Project and other projects, and the sales of carpark spaces performed the best. This was mainly due to the adoption of new sales strategy in strengthening investment solicitation, which enhanced the projects’ image and value. The following table shows revenue by operating segment for the Period: (RMB million) (RMB million) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) During the Period, the Group recorded property sales of approximately RMB73.1 million, representing an approximate 67.4% decrease from the approximate RMB224.2 million of the same period of last year. This was mainly due to a GFA delivered of 9,613.94 sq.m., which represented a decrease of approximately 27,785.72 sq.m. from approximately 37,399.66 sq.m. of the same period of last year. This was mainly caused by the decrease in GFA delivered from the Taizhou Project by 19,658.09 sq.m. compared to the same period last year, and the decrease in GFA delivered from the Hangzhou Project by approximately 7,267.77 sq.m. compared to the same period last year. The decrease in GFA delivered was also caused by the drop of approximately 4,941.94 sq.m. in GFA delivered from the Shanghai Project during the Period as compared with the corresponding period last year. The Group’s property leasing business consists of leasing Group’s commercial properties held for investment and the sold commercial properties leased back from third parties by the Group.

During the Period, rental income amounted to approximately RMB30.8 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB6.8 million or 28.3% from approximately RMB24.0 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to increases in occupancy rate.

Gross profit margin was approximately 20.5%, compared to approximately 50.0% in the same period of last year, which resulted in a 29.5% decrease. This was mainly due to a significant decrease in gross profit margin for the Shanghai Project during the Period in comparison to the same period last year. It is expected that the Group’s gross profit margin will maintain a gradual uptrend in the second half of 2019. During the Period, other income and revenue amounted to approximately RMB8.5 million, a significant increase of approximately RMB7.6 million compared to the approximate RMB0.9 million from the same period last year, which was mainly due to foreign exchange and government subsidy amounting to RMB8.3 million were recorded during the Period. During the Period, sales and administration expenses amounted to approximately RMB53.0 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB16.6 million or 23.8% compared to approximately RMB69.6 million for the same period last year. Distribution expenses decreased by approximately RMB10.0 million, mainly due to decreased advertising and sales commissions for the Hangzhou Project during the Period. Administrative expenses decreased by approximately RMB6.6 million compared with the same period last year. During the Period, other expenses amounted to approximately RMB16.4 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB1.0 million or 6.5% compared to approximately RMB15.4 million for the same period last year. This was mainly due to assets impairment loss. During the Period, the operating loss was approximately RMB17.0 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB7.8 million or approximately 31.4% compared to the loss of approximately RMB24.8 million for the same period last year. During the Period, the change in fair value of investment properties amounted to approximately RMB32.4 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB31.8 million compared to approximately RMB0.6 million from the same period last year.

During the Period, income tax expenses were approximately RMB28.0 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB15.0 million or 34.9% than the income tax expense of approximately RMB43.0 million for the same period last year.

Rimbaco Group Global Limited Interim Report 2020 BUSINESS REVIEW (Continued) During 1H2020, the Group submitted 4 tenders for factory projects and 1 tender for institutional, commercial and/or residential project. These tenders represent an expected aggregate contract sum of approximately RM413.0 million. As at 30 April 2020, the Group was awarded 1 contract with an aggregate original contract sum of RM14.6 million, while 2 tenders had failed and 2 tenders’ results were still pending. The outbreak of the COVID-19, together with the implementation of various forms of containment measures by the Malaysian government had caused negative impacts on the economy of Malaysia and the construction industry. On 16 March 2020, the Malaysian government announced the Movement Control Order (“MCO”) issued under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 to combat the rise of COVID-19. Among others, the MCO included restrictions on mass movements and gatherings and business shutdown, interstate and international travel bans etc. The MCO took effect from 18 March 2020 to 31 March 2020, followed by a second phase from 1 April 2020 to 14 April 2020, a third phase from 15 April 2020 to 28 April 2020, and a fourth phase from 29 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. Due to the MCO, all the construction activities of the Group suspended on 18 March 2020. Following the suspension of the construction activities, the Group stopped making purchases from its suppliers, suspended the work of its subcontractors, and requested all of its employees to work from home. As at 30 April 2020, the Group was still under work suspension. During this period, the Group’s financial performance, business operation and future prospects were negatively affected by the extension of time for completing the building construction projects due to the MCO. The Group has been negotiating with its customers to seek for extension of completion date to accommodate for delay or disruption of work progress. As of 30 April 2020, the Group had not experienced any termination of projects. On 10 May 2020, the Malaysian government announced the fifth phase of the MCO which entailed re-opening of the majority of Malaysia’s economic sectors conditional on implementing stringent health Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) for another four weeks from 13 May 2020 to 9 June 2020 (Conditional MCO, the “CMCO”). By virtue of the CMCO, The Group had to follow the SOP and perform COVID-19 test for all foreign workers. As a result, the Group’s construction activities can only be carried out in small groups due to social distancing and pending COVID-19 test results of the workers and limited working hours. Time spent to comply with the SOP had hampered our work progress. On 7 June 2020, the Malaysian government further relaxed the restrictions by introduction of the Recovery MCO phase from 10 June 2020 to 31 August 2020. However, the Group expected to resume its construction activities gradually and will only be able to operate with full capacity in July 2020. The Group has been adopting precautionary and control measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s operations, including but not limited to flexible work-from-home practices, procurement of hygiene products for pandemic prevention and control, education on the workers about hygienic practices to ensure SOP are not only practiced at their work place but also at their accommodations to reduce the risks of COVID-19 transmission. FUTURE PROSPECTS (Continued) Looking ahead, the second half of the financial year ending 31 October 2020 will be filled with challenges and uncertainties. The Directors anticipate that there are risks that the disruptions in the supply chain of the construction industry (such as building materials, equipment, imported items and workforce) may not be fully re-established in the short term due to quarantines and work stoppages resulted from preventive measures imposed by the government. The Directors will continue to assess the impact of the pandemic on the Group’s operations and financial performance and closely monitor the Group’s exposure to the risks and uncertainties in connection with the pandemic. Further to that, the Group will adhere to prudent financial management in project selection and cost control. In conclusion, despite the negative impacts the COVID-19 pandemic had caused to the Group’s operation and financial standing, the Group had maintained its cash reserves at a sufficient level. At the same time, in view of the large-scale economic stimulus policies introduced by Malaysian government and the potential growth of the Group’s emerging businesses, the Group will try its best to look for new business opportunities to offset the negative impacts of the COVID-19. The Group’s revenue decreased by approximately RM20.8 million, or 18.1%, from approximately RM114.8 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM94.0 million for 1H2020. Such decrease was mainly due to Crimson Omega (a commercial development project) and IHOS (an institutional development project) were still at their respective initial stage during 1H2020 following the completion of two sizeable factory projects FOM and STC6 which contributed to a substantial portion of the revenue for 1H2019. % of total % of total Institutional, commercial and/or Rimbaco Group Global Limited Interim Report 2020 Revenue (Continued) During 1H2020, the revenue attributable to factories and institutional, commercial and/or residential buildings amounted to approximately RM12.1 million and approximately RM81.0 million (1H2019: approximately RM38.4 million and approximately RM74.0 million), respectively, representing approximately 12.9% and 86.2% (1H2019: approximately 33.5% and 64.5%), of the total revenue of the Group, respectively. As at 30 April 2020, the Group had an outstanding order book of approximately RM665.6 million (31 October 2019: approximately RM745.3 million). Despite decrease in revenue for 1H2020, the Group’s gross profit increased by approximately RM6.4 million, or 43.2%, from approximately RM14.8 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM21.2 million for 1H2020. Such increase was mainly due to the lower cost of services recorded and the reversal of liquidated and ascertained damages of approximately RM6.9 million which was previously recognised as cost of services in the financial year ended 31 October 2017. The overall gross profit margin increased by approximately 9.6% from approximately 12.9% for 1H2019 to approximately 22.5% for 1H2020. The increase in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to the reversal of liquidated and ascertained damages of approximately RM6.9 million which previously recognised as cost of services in the financial year ended 31 October 2017. The Group’s other income, gain and loss slightly increased from approximately RM0.4 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM0.7 million for 1H2020 which was mainly due to the increase in gain on disposal of investment properties. The Group’s administrative and other expenses increased by approximately RM2.1 million or 39.6% from approximately RM5.3 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM7.4 million for 1H2020, which was mainly due to listing expenses incurred of approximately RM4.6 million charged to the Group’s profit or loss for 1H2020 as compared with approximately RM3.1 million for 1H2019. The Group’s finance costs increased by approximately RM0.1 million from approximately RM0.4 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM0.5 million for 1H2020 which was mainly due to increase in interest charged on bill facilities. The Group’s income tax expense increased by approximately RM1.4 million or 45.2% from approximately RM3.1 million for 1H2019 to approximately RM4.5 million for 1H2020. The effective tax rate for the 1H2020 is 31.9% which is higher than the Malaysian corporate income tax rate of 24% mainly due to the listing expenses amounting to approximately RM4.6 million for 1H2020 is a non-deductible expenses. As a result of the foregoing, the Group reported profit attributable to owners of the Company of approximately RM9.6 million for 1H2020, representing an increase of approximately RM3.2 million or 50.0% as compared to approximately RM6.4 million for 1H2019. Gearing ratio of the Group (calculated by dividing the total debts (lease liabilities) by total equity and multiplied by 100%) decreased from approximately 7.8% as at 31 October 2019 to approximately 3.7% as at 30 April 2020, which was mainly due to decrease in lease liabilities and as a result of new shares issued from the Listing.

Such increase was mainly benefiting from the proceeds of the Listing for working capital purpose. The Directors consider the level of cash balances to be reasonable, which would enable the Company to maintain its liquidity position in settling the progress payments on time to subcontractors and enhance its position as main contractor’s competitiveness despite the outbreak of COVID-19. As at 30 April 2020, the current ratio of the Group was approximately 2.98 times (31 October 2019: approximately 1.56 times).

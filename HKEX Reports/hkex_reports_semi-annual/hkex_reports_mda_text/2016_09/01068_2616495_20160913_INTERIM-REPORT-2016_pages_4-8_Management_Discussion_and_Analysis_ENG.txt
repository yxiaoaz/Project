Industry Overview (and outlook) During the six months ended 30 June 2016 (the “Review Period”), China’s national economy performed stably with advancement. According to the data published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s gross domestic product for the first half of this year was Renminbi (“RMB”) 34,063.7 billion, representing an increase of 6.7% as compared to the same period last However, in the first half of this year, affected by factors such as tight market supply, hog prices rose rapidly and increased significantly by approximately 48% compared to the same period last year to approximately RMB21.4 per kilogram, being the highest price in the past 5 years. During the Review Period, pork production in China amounted to 24.73 million tons, representing a decrease of 3.9% over the same period last year. During the Review Period, the number of live hogs production of China was approximately 402 million heads, representing a decrease of 3.7% over the same period in 2015; the number of hogs output was approximately 320 million heads, representing a year on year decrease of 4.4% as compared to the same period last year. As the hog farmers’ incentives to rebuild inventories resumed gradually and the supply should improve steadily, pork prices are therefore expected to decrease in the second half of 2016. Facing all these enormous challenges, China Yurun Food Group Limited (the “Company” or “Yurun Food”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”) will continue to make its best efforts to adopt a number of prudent actions to maintain the stability of its business. During the Review Period, pork prices rose rapidly and maintained at a high level. Certain consumers chose other meats as alternatives, which worsened the pork consumption. The Group experienced greater difficulty in transferring cost to consumers with rising production cost and sluggish market for high-end catering and meat consumption. Despite all the unfavorable factors during the Review Period, the Group continued to adhere to its belief to provide quality meat products for consumers against the backdrop of the challenging market environment. Product Quality and Research and During the Review Period, under the leadership of the Group’s management, Yurun Food adhered to its operation philosophy of “you trust because we care”, took the lead in the industry development by technical research and development, and ensured product quality through advanced production process and technology. Yurun Food ranked top in terms of market shares of low temperature meat products (“LTMP”) and chilled pork in China, and successively topped the LTMP and chilled pork market in China in terms of market shares for the consecutive eighteenth year and fourth year respectively in the Annual Conference of the Development of Consumer Markets and the Release of Product Sales Statistics of the China Market ( ) held in March 2016. The Group will continue to ensure high product quality, and focus on research and development of products which are well received by the market, so as to maintain its competitive advantages. Chilled pork and LTMP, which are the Group’s products with higher added value, remained the focus of the overall business development of the Group during the Review Period. Sales of chilled pork of the Group was HK$7.233 billion (1H2015: HK$6.953 billion) during the Review Period, representing an increase of 4.0% over the same period last year, accounting for approximately 80% (1H2015: 71%) of the total revenue of the Group prior to inter-segment eliminations and approximately 91% (1H2015: 82%) of the total revenue of the upstream slaughtering segment. Sales of LTMP was HK$1.002 billion (1H2015: HK$1.201 billion), representing a decrease of 16.6% over the same period last year, accounting for approximately 11% (1H2015: 12%) of the total revenue of the Group prior to inter-segment eliminations and approximately 90% (1H2015: 92%) of the total revenue of the downstream processed meat segment. Production Facilities and Production Adhering to the strict cost control on investment, the Group adjusted its expansion pace according to the market changes and business conditions of the Group.

During the Review Period, the slaughtering volume of the Group was approximately 3.42 million heads, representing a decrease of approximately 32.1% over the same period last year, mainly because the Group positioned improvements in profitability as its objective and made appropriate compromise to the slaughtering volume in light of the significant increase in hog prices and decrease in overall pork consumption in China. Total sales derived from upstream business (before inter- segment eliminations) decreased by 6.2% to HK$7.941 billion (1H2015: HK$8.470 billion) as compared with the same period last year of which, sales of chilled pork increased by 4.0% to HK$7.233 billion (1H2015: HK$6.953 billion) as compared with the same period last year, accounting for approximately 80% (1H2015: 71%) and approximately 91% (1H2015: 82%) of the total revenue (before inter-segment eliminations) of the Group and the total revenue of the upstream business of the Group respectively.

Specifically, revenue of LTMP was HK$1.002 billion, representing a decrease of 16.6% as compared with HK$1.201 billion of the same period last year, accounting for approximately 90% (1H2015: 92%) of the processed meat segment. LTMP remained the key revenue driver to the processed meat business. Revenue of high temperature meat products (“HTMP”) was HK$107 million (1H2015: HK$111 million), accounting for approximately 10% (1H2015: 8%) of the total revenue of the processed meat segment.

Overall gross profit margin increased by 1.3 percentage points to 4.0% from 2.7% of the same period last year. During the Review Period, production costs of the Group increased along with the significant rising pork price. The Group therefore adjusted sales channels where appropriate, set increasing profits as the goal and reduced sales to the relatively low- margin channel. In respect of the upstream business, gross profit margin of chilled pork and frozen pork were 1.8% and -0.1% respectively (1H2015: 3.8% and -13.6% respectively). Increase in hog price improved the gross profit margin of frozen pork significantly.

In respect of the downstream processed meat products, gross profit margin of LTMP was 19.3%, representing an increase of 4.5 percentage points from 14.8% of the same period last year. Since the Group adjusted the product mix of HTMP and purchased certain raw materials at a lower price in the second half of 2015 that lowered the production cost, gross profit margin of HTMP significantly increased by 21.1 percentage points from 13.7% over the same period last year to 34.8%. The overall gross profit margin of the downstream segment was 20.8%, representing an increase of 6.1 percentage points from 14.7% of the same period last During the Review Period, other net loss of the Group was HK$62.98 million (1H2015: other net income of HK$50.48 million).

Operating expenses included distribution expenses and administrative and other operating expenses. During the Review Period, operating expenses of the Group were HK$762 million, representing a decrease of 13.5% from HK$881 million of the same period last year.

In addition, the Group cut certain positions to save costs and the staff salary and related staff costs thereby reduced. Other operating expenses including impairment losses on certain non-current assets of approximately HK$37.62 million during the Review Period (1H2015: HK$34.16 million).

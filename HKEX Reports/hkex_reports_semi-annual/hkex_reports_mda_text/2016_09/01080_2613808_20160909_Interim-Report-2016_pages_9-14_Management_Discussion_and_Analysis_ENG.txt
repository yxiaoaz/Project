The Group is one of the largest oil and gas pipeline manufacturers in the PRC with leading product quality. In spite of the promising prospects of the oil and gas pipeline industry, major pipeline projects of CNPC and Sinopec to be constructed made sluggish progress in the first half of 2016. Accordingly, the Group shifted its business focus to local markets in the PRC during the Period under Review by establishing professional sales teams and stepping up sales efforts, and made profound progress in securing orders for local pipeline projects. During the Period under Review, the Group succeeded in securing orders for local pipeline projects with product volume of 175,000 tonnes, representing a significant increase of 75% as compared to 100,000 tonnes in the same period of last year. As at 30 June 2016, product volume under outstanding orders was approximately 140,000 tonnes. As at 30 June 2016, the Group’s production capacity of submerged-arc helical welded pipes (“SAWH pipes”) reached 1.45 million tonnes per annum, and that of submerged-arc longitudinal welded pipes (“SAWL pipes”) was 400,000 tonnes per annum, and that of a supporting anti-corrosion production line was 10.80 million square meters, which have continued to consolidate the Group’s leading position in respect of technology and production capacity in the industry. Being one of the largest oil and gas pipe manufacturers in the PRC with top facilities, advanced technique and a comprehensive quality check and assurance system, the Group is one of the few suppliers of pipes designed with large diameter which can sustain the high pressure in long-distance transportation of crude oil, refined petroleum and natural gas. It is also the only privately-owned enterprise among the handful of suppliers in the PRC who are qualified to supply to major oil and natural gas pipeline projects. Major customers of the Group include large state-owned oil and gas companies such as CNPC and Sinopec, and their subsidiaries. The Group focuses on the design, manufacturing, anti-corrosion processing and servicing of pipes (including SAWH pipes and SAWL pipes) which are used to transport crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas. As at 30 June 2016, the total length of the world’s major oil and gas pipelines using pipes produced by the Group was approximately 26,100 kilometers, of which 94.3% have been installed in the PRC and the remaining 5.7% have been installed overseas. In the first half of 2016, the Group took part in the production of a number of national SAWH pipeline projects, including, amongst others, the Tianjin LNG transportation trunk Project ( (LNG) ), the Yizheng-Changling Dual Crude Oil Pipeline Project (Section II of Yizheng-Jiujiang section) ( — ), and the rectification of potential risk issues of the Luning Oil Pipeline Project Phase II ( ). Major regional SAWH pipeline projects that the Group participated in were, amongst others, the Centralized Heat Supply Pipeline Network Project in Yangcheng County, Shanxi ( ), the Zhangze Electric-heated Pipeline Project in Huairen County, Shanxi ( ), the Wantong Fossil Fuel Oil And Refined Oil Transportation Project in Dongying Port ( — ), Zhaohua Bridge Project ( ), the Yuxi-Pu’er Natural Gas Branch Pipeline Project ( — ), Fuzhou-Pingtan Strait Rail/Road Bridge Project ( ), and the Sanmen Bay Bridge Project ( ). Major anti-corrosion projects it undertook were, amongst others, the Tianjin LNG transportation trunk Project ( (LNG) ), the Wantong Fossil Fuel Oil And Refined Oil Transportation Project in Dongying Port ( — ), the rectification of potential risk issues of the Luning Oil Pipeline Project Phase II ( ), and the Yizheng-Changling Dual Crude Oil Pipeline Project (Section II of Yizheng-Jiujiang section) ( — ). Projects using SAWL pipelines were, amongst others, the Wenchuan-Tibet Bridge Project ( ), the Wantong Fossil Fuel Oil And Refined Oil Transportation Project in Dongying Port ( — ), the Huaneng Suzhou Natural Gas Pipeline Project ( ), the Tailings Transportation System Project in Pulang Copper Mine ( ), and the Xinchu Qingtian Plaza Project ( ). During the Period under Review, total revenue of the Group’s pipes business was approximately RMB193,282,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB213,481,000), accounting for approximately 22.0% (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately 19.4%) of the Group’s total revenue. This revenue comprised the followings: (1) revenue from the sale of SAWH pipes of approximately RMB148,014,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB202,752,000), representing a decrease of approximately 27.0% as compared with the corresponding period last year; (2) revenue from the sale of SAWL pipes of approximately RMB21,801,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB6,085,000); (3) revenue from the anti-corrosion processing service of approximately RMB23,195,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB4,624,000), representing an increase of approximately 401.6% as compared with the corresponding period last year; and (4) revenue from the cold-formed section steel business of approximately RMB272,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB20,000). In order to fully utilize the business network of its current customers and other existing resources, the Group also engages in the metal commodity trading business. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, revenue of this business was approximately RMB686,034,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB887,276,000). The tender for Line 2 of the Sino-Russian Crude Oil Pipeline ( ) to be built in parallel to the constructed Mohe-Daqing Pipeline commenced on 13 May 2016, in which the SAWH pipes of Shandong Shengli Steel Pipe of the Group won 12.27% of the total tender volume. The pipeline will run 941.8 kilometers through Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, with a diameter of 813mm. Having 43 pipeline block valve stations all along, it will traverse 4 large-scale rivers, 7 medium-scale rivers, 16 railways and 4 second grade or above highways. Line 2 of the Sino-Russian Crude Oil Pipeline, upon completion, together with the Mohe- Daqing Pipeline, will deliver an annual transmission capacity of 30 million tonnes in total. Recently, the construction of No. 4 Shaanxi-Beijing Gas Pipeline Project ( ) has been fully commenced. The project includes 1 main pipeline and 3 straight pipelines, out of which 1 main pipeline and 1 straight pipeline with an aggregate length of 1,114 kilometers and a designed annual gas transmission capacity of 25 billion cubic meters will be constructed during the current period. The main pipeline will start from Jingbian in Shaanxi Province, running through Inter Mongolia and Hebei Province, and end at Gaoliying, Beijing. The Group will undertake part of the production of the pipelines in the second half of the year. While the date of commencement of major pipeline projects such as the New Gas Pipeline and the Sino-Russian Eastern Natural Gas Pipeline is still uncertain, preliminary works have been underway. The Group believes that the major pipeline projects will get back on the right track in the near future in which time the Group, being one of the largest oil and gas pipeline manufacturers in the PRC, will strive to receive more orders given its advantages in terms of production capacity, geographical locations of subsidiaries as well as pre-welding and precision-welding technology. Moreover, the Group will continue to explore opportunities of local pipeline projects in the PRC, which the Group considers to be in great demand for oil and gas pipelines in consequence of the implementation of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative. Leveraging on its quality products and cutting edge technology, the Group is confident that it can seize the tremendous opportunities in the countries covered by the initiative and secure more overseas orders. In addition to developing oil and gas pipeline products, the Group has been actively exploring opportunities to form new partnership. On 29 March 2015, the Group entered into an agreement through Gold Apple Holdings Limited to acquire 56% of the allotted and issued share capital of Blossom Time Group Limited (the “Acquisition”). At present, detailed exploration work and assessment work have been completed and the mining license is pending final approval. The capital commitments to the aforesaid Acquisition will be funded by the Group’s internal resources and the proceeds of the subscriptions under general mandate on 12 April 2016. Besides, possessing the advantages of upstream resources and favourable geographical location, the Group has been actively expanding into the market of bulk transaction of fuel oil and refined oil through drawing on the experience of metal trading in recent years and fully exploiting and capitalizing on bank credit resources of domestic subsidiaries. The Group has thereby broadened its income sources and continued to generate stable revenue. Domestic subsidiaries have been actively carrying out the preparation work for the new business, and Shanghai Shengguan has conducted its first transaction in July 2016. It is expected that the new business will serve as another crucial income source and profit driver for the Group. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to make full use of its advantages in terms of production capacity, geographical locations of subsidiaries as well as pre-welding and precision-welding technology. Under the implementation of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the Group will endeavour to grasp the rapid growth opportunities emerging in the regions covered by the initiative in connection with local infrastructure construction, resource development as well as industrial and financial cooperation. This will ensure stable income in the future and realize the strategy for a sustainable, stable and healthy development of the Group, hence bringing better returns to shareholders. The Group’s unaudited revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was approximately RMB879,316,000, representing a decrease of approximately 20.1% when compared to that of approximately RMB1,100,757,000 for the corresponding period last year. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, amongst the Group’s two core business segments, (1) the pipes business recorded a revenue of approximately RMB193,282,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB213,481,000), representing a decrease of approximately 9.5% when compared to the corresponding period last year. The revenue decreased as a result of a decrease in the price of steel plates, the major material of pipes, leading to a corresponding decrease in selling price, with similar sales recorded in the current year as compared to the corresponding period last year; (2) the metal commodity trading business recorded a revenue of approximately RMB686,034,000 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately RMB887,276,000). The revenue of the Period under Review recorded a year-on-year decrease due to the market fluctuation. The Group’s cost of sales and services decreased year-on-year by approximately 21.5% from approximately RMB1,086,716,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately RMB852,643,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Gross profit for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was approximately RMB26,673,000. The Group’s gross profit margin rose from approximately 1.3% for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately 3.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2016, which was mainly due to the facts that the anti-corrosion services which have a higher gross profit recorded a significant year-on-year increase in the Period under Review. In addition, the cost of the major material of pipes decreased while the processing fee income remained relatively stable. The Group’s other income and gains for the six months ended 30 June 2016 amounted to approximately RMB13,410,000, representing a decrease of approximately 52.7% when compared to the corresponding period last year, which was mainly due to the fact that one-off compensation was received in connection with the disposal of Beijing Golden Fortune Investment Co., Ltd.* ( ) in the corresponding period last year, while there was no such income in the Period under Review. Selling and distribution costs of the Group decreased from approximately RMB11,197,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately RMB9,697,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Such decrease was principally due to a decrease in the transportation fee for pipes in the pipes business in the Period under Review. The Group’s administrative expenses increased from approximately RMB67,367,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately RMB116,458,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to the shutdown expenses incurred by the lack of production of our pipes business, together with the difference and loss incurred from the translation between local and foreign currencies in the Period under Review. The Group’s finance costs decreased by approximately 28.6% from approximately RMB30,207,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately RMB21,573,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. All the finance costs came from interests on bank loans. The Group’s total comprehensive loss for the period decreased from a loss of approximately RMB134,644,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to a loss of approximately RMB111,498,000 for the six months ended 30 June As at 30 June 2016, the Group’s total assets amounted to approximately RMB3,279,348,000 (31 December 2015: approximately RMB3,445,151,000) and the Group’s net assets amounted to approximately RMB1,879,533,000 (31 December 2015: approximately RMB1,858,945,000). Net assets per share amounted to approximately RMB0.57, representing a decrease of approximately RMB11 cents when compared to that of 31 December 2015. As at 30 June 2016, the Group’s total liabilities amounted to approximately RMB1,399,815,000 (31 December 2015: approximately RMB1,586,206,000). The decrease in total liabilities was mainly attributable to a decrease in borrowings. As at 30 June 2016, cash and cash equivalents of the Group amounted to approximately RMB264,111,000 (31 December 2015: approximately RMB393,881,000).

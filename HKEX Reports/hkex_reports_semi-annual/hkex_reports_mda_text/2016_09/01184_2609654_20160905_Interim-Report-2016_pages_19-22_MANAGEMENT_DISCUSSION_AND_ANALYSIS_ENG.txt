However, mainly due to the slowing down of growth of global handset shipments amid weak global economy and the loss of revenue after the spun off of Hi-Level Technology Holdings Limited (“Hi-Level Technology”) on 7 January 2016, the Group’s component sales revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was HK$4.3 billion, decreased 19.5% from HK$5.3 billion recorded in same period in 2015. In spite of this, after the Group’s effort to explore and develop several product lines with high growth potential, the Group component revenue regained growth momentum since May 2016 on a year-on-year basis. During the period under review, our GVE team recorded growth in revenue and profit by delivering more innovative environmental-friendly lifestyle enhancement finished products under our owned brands of “Light in Motion” and “Life in Motion” in the Asia Pacific region.

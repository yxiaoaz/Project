During the period, demand for solar modules has grown rapidly and it led to an overall increase in solar module sales. Based on the data released by the National Energy Administration of China, for the first quarter of 2016, the newly-added volume of photovoltaic power generation to grid connection was 7.14GW in China and its cumulative grid connection installation capacity of photovoltaic power generation has reached 50.31GW (first quarter of 2015: 33.12GW), growing by 52% compared to the corresponding period of 2015, of which photovoltaic power plants accounted for 43.28W and distributed power plants accounted for 7.03GW. The volume of annual photovoltaic power generation grew by more than 47% year-on-year to approximately 11.8 billion kWh. On the other hand, although the average selling price of photovoltaic products has been declining gradually, production has become more efficient as a result of technological improvement in the production process. This has enabled the industry to maintain a stable gross profit margin. With the continued recovery in the global solar market, expected market demand will continue to rally by improving the conversion efficiency and decrease in price of raw materials and earnings will remain stable in the industry. According to the preliminary estimate, the newly- added volume of photovoltaic power generation to grid connection in China would reach 20GW in the first half of 2016, which out-performed forecasts at the beginning of the year. It is expected that the full year newly-added volume of photovoltaic power generation to grid connection could reach 30GW, maintaining its leading position in the world. Regarding the market in Japan, its market demand slows down in 2016. GTM Research predicted that the annual installation of Japan in 2016 will slightly decrease to 10.2GW. The market is expected to shift to rooftops PV systems. From the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF”) report, between 2016 and 2040, Japan will add 94GW of new solar, including 65GW of rooftop PV. Despite the slight decline in demand, the 2020 PV installation target has been revised to 65.7GW according to the modified version of “PV Outlook 2030” published by The Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (“JPEA”). For the USA market, PV installations in the first quarter of 2016 amounted to 1.67GW, representing a 24% growth compared to the corresponding period of 2015. The cumulative US solar PV installations reached 27.5GW of operating solar PV capacity across the country based on the report by GTM Research and Solar Energy Industries Association (“SEIA”). GTM Research forecasted that it will be another record year for the U.S. PV market in 2016, with installations reaching 14.5 GW, a 94% increase over 2015. The residential and non-residential PV markets are both expected to grow year-over-year. Market Overview (continued) For emerging markets, it is expected that they will play a big part in 2016. GTM Research forecasted a 127% growth in the Indian market over this year and it is poised to become the fourth largest solar market in 2016. It is even forecasted to install as much solar in 2020 as all of Europe, representing 13% of the global market. Meanwhile, Latin American capacity is expected to double in size this year, with Mexico and Brazil as the two most promising regions in Latin America. GTM Research predicted, by 2020, Latin America will add a total of 21GW PV installations. The Middle East and Turkey will add also 16GW from Algeria, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and the U.A.E. Furthermore, Asian countries of Thailand, The Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia will add 15GW in total. The Group is one of the leading manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon solar products in the PRC. Due to the advantages in its vertical integration, the Group focuses on the manufacture and sale of mono- crystalline silicon solar wafers and photovoltaic modules; and design and installation of photovoltaic systems. The Group sell photovoltaic products directly to end-user customers. Demand for and sales of our downstream products helped drive demand for upstream and midstream products. This thoroughly adheres to our vertical integration strategy and covers the whole industry chain of photovoltaic industry. During the period, demand for solar modules has grown rapidly and it led to an increase in solar module sales. The commissioning of the additional module manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2016 enabled the Group to capture this growth in demand. On the other hand, although the average selling price of photovoltaic products has been declining gradually, production has become more efficient as a result of technological improvement in the production process. The Group has been able to maintain a stable level of gross profit margin. With the continued recovery in the global solar market, expected market demand will continue to rally, and the Group expects that earnings will remain stable. The Group recorded a turnover of RMB1,723.799 million, compared with RMB1,306.291 million for the corresponding period last year. External shipment volume amounted to 749.7MW during the period, as compared to 487MW for the corresponding period last year. Gross profit increased by RMB32.011 million to RMB196.535 million as compared to RMB164.524 million for the corresponding period last year. Gross profit margin remained stable at around 12%. During the period under review, apart from day-to-day business operations, the Group is also actively improving the financial statement position. In order to improve production efficiency, certain obsolete equipment was disposed of, which led to a loss of RMB26.227 million; in order to reduce idle inventory and to replenish working capital, certain amount of polysilicon purchased at high prices have been sold, which led to a loss of RMB23.610 million. Further, as the Renminbi depreciated during the period under review, it led to an exchange loss of RMB10.826 million. In summary, excluding the above extraordinary items, the adjusted net profit would be RMB14.071 million. In the first half of 2016, the Group continued its great cooperation with clients along the whole photovoltaic industry chain, consolidated its own leading edges of upstream and midstream business, and actively explored the downstream business and the respective development to go with its strategy on vertical integration. The operation of various business remained impressive during the period and is expected to continue its improvement and record stronger results in the short future. The Group’s all-rounded photovoltaic industry chain with its vertically integrated business model covering both upstream and downstream businesses allows external sales of its upstream products such as silicon ingots, wafers and cells which are produced and processed in- house, apart from being used in its downstream business. During the period under review, the Group maintained stable capacity for silicon ingot and wafer production to address the demand of customers and its downstream businesses. As at 30 June 2016, the Group maintained a combined annual production capacity of 1.2GW for monocrystalline silicon ingots in the Jinzhou production base in Liaoning and the Xining base in Qinghai, and an annual wafer production capacity of 900MW. Silicon Ingot and Wafer Business (continued) During the period under review, the market is still dominated by multi- crystalline silicon products, which resulted in the less-than-expected demand for monocrystalline silicon products in the market. However, with the continued realisation of advantages in better improvement in conversion efficiency, lower and stabler decay rate in its photovoltaic systems, continued reduction in unit costs, etc, it is expected that the market share of monocrystalline silicon products will increase significantly. Further, over the years, the external shipment of solar energy silicon ingots and wafers shifted gradually from P-type to N-type. This was mainly driven by a shift in demand for N-type products which have a higher conversion efficiency, thereby leading to the sales growth of N-type products. We have secured a leading position in the monocrystalline silicon solar ingot manufacturing industry in terms of technology, product quality and quantity. Major products are silicon ingots of 8 inches to 8.7 inches in diameter. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of our monocrystalline silicon products is also higher than the industry average. Apart from the traditional P-type products, the Group mainly provides N-type high performance products with a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 22%–23%. During the period under review, approximately 99% of the total external shipment volume of silicon ingots are N-type silicon ingots, targeting primarily the Japanese market where the requirements on quality standard is stringent. Combined with internal utilisation of monocrystalline silicon wafers in the Group’s production into monocrystalline solar modules, sales of monocrystalline silicon ingots and wafers is expected to increase in the next couple of years. In addition, since the disposal of land last year, the Group have also disposed of certain obsolete equipment during the period under review, and expedited the overall installation of diamond saw in its wafer slicing capacity, in order to improve production efficiency and to match its expansion of downstream module manufacturing capacity. The Group production lines of solar cells are located at the manufacturing base of the Group in Jinzhou, Liaoning. During the period under review, the annual production capacity of solar cells was 330MW. Such solar cells are on the one hand sold internally to provide high-quality raw materials supply for the downstream module business of the Group, and also sold to the customers in China and Japan. Focusing on the implementation of the vertical integration strategy, a large portion of solar cells are utilised internally for the production of modules. The Group is hence able to capture a higher level of gross profit through the production of all segments from raw material to end product. During the period under review, the internally-utilised volume of solar cells was 95% of the total shipment volume of solar cells. Comparing to 66% for the corresponding period in 2015, the ratio has increased significantly. The main reason was the commissioning of the additional module manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2016 and most of the solar cells have been reserved for internal utilisation. During the period, demand for solar modules has grown rapidly and it led to an increase in solar module sales. With the continued recovery in the global solar market, expected market demand will continue to rally, the Group expects that earnings will remain stable. During the period under review, external shipment of the Group reached 349MW, compared to 231.1MW in the corresponding period last year. This represented an increase of 51%. The increase in external shipment was mainly made possible with the commissioning of the additional module manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2016 in order to satisfy more of the orders. Further, apart from continuing strong co-operations with its key customers, including Chinese state-owned enterprise and Japanese conglomerate, the Group has developed new customer relationships during the period under review. As mentioned above, through the expansion of module production capacity in the first half of 2016, it enabled the Group to cope with more orders from the Chinese state- owned enterprises (“SOE”), hence improving the geographical shipment proportion. The proportion has improved from 78% overseas versus 22% local sales in the first half of 2015 to 46% overseas versus 54% local sales. This is approaching a more sustainable balance set out by the management. To consolidate its advantages of the business model of vertical integration, the Group actively expanded the business of end-user market apart from its efforts in stabilizing its upstream and midstream business development, thereby driving demand for products from downstream to upstream. As at 30 June 2016, the Group held 70% equity interest in Golmud Solargiga Energy Electric Power Co., Ltd. (“Golmud”). On 27 July 2016, the Group entered into agreements with the vendors, pursuant to which the Group has agreed to acquire from the vendors an aggregate of 30% equity interest in Golmud for an aggregate consideration of RMB32.250 million. After completion of the acquisition, the Group is expected to own 100% interest in Golmud. Golmud is principally engaged in the operation of a 20MW large scaled photovoltaic power plant in Golmud, Qinghai province. Construction of the project was completed at the end of 2011, it primarily adopted the modules produced by the Group’s vertical integration, and it is currently generating approximately 33 million kWh per year. The power plant is enjoying the photovoltaic power generation feed-in tariff policy of RMB1.15 per kWh as set out by the National Development and Reform Commission. Further, during the period under review, income arising from operating of photovoltaic system business has increased to RMB26.579 million, compared to RMB18.336 million in the corresponding period in 2015. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, the revenue of the Group was RMB1,723.799 million, representing an increase of 32.0% compared with the corresponding period in 2015. The commissioning of the additional module manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2016 enabled the Group to capture this growth in demand. With the continued recovery in the global solar market, expected market demand will continue to rally, the Group expects that earnings will remain stable. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, cost of sales increased by 33.8% to RMB1,527.264 million from RMB1,141.767 million for the corresponding period ended 30 June 2015. Cost of sales represented 88.6% of total turnover, an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to corresponding period in 2015. The increase in ratio was a result of gradual decline in the industry average selling price of photovoltaic products offset by the success in the improved technological improvement in the production process during the period under review. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, revenue increased and gross profit margin remained stable, the Group recorded a gross profit of RMB196.535 million and a gross profit margin of 11.4%, as compared to gross profit of RMB164.524 million and gross profit margin of 12.6% for the corresponding period in 2015. Selling and distribution expenses mainly comprised packaging expenses, freight charges and insurance expenses. Selling and distribution expenses increased by 105% to RMB14.977 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 from RMB7.313 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in selling and distribution expense was mainly due to the increase in volume of external shipment during the six months ended 30 June 2016. Administrative expenses mainly comprised staff costs and research and development expenses. The administrative expenses for the first half of 2016 amounted to RMB106.807 million, increased by 14.8% as compared to RMB93.014 million for the corresponding period in 2015. It was mainly due to the follow-up administrative costs incurred in 2016 after the relocation of certain manufacturing plant during the second half of 2015. Further, the Group focuses on the implementation of cost control measures, in order to improve its administrative expenses to turnover ratio. Finance costs represented mainly bank loans interest. The finance costs of the Group increased from RMB58.347 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to RMB60.144 million for the six months ended 30 June The increase was mainly due to the growth in amount of sales and purchases during the period. However, it was noted that the finance cost to turnover ratio has decreased from 4.47% in the corresponding period of 2015 to 3.49% in the six months ended 30 June 2016. The decrease in finance cost to turnover ratio was mainly due to better financial control on the use of funds during the period. Income tax expense were RMB13.416 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016, while the income tax expense amounted to RMB0.09 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to the rise in solar cell and module businesses during the six months ended 30 June 2016, which led to all the tax loss brought forward being fully utilised. Income tax expense recorded for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was attributable to the taxable profits generated by the solar module business in China. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, the Group recorded a loss attributable to the equity shareholders of RMB49.557 million, as compared to a profit attributable to the equity shareholders of RMB10.189 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The inventories of the Group comprised mainly raw materials, namely polysilicon, crucibles and other auxiliary raw materials, and finished goods. During the period under review, the inventory turnover days of the Group were 67 days (the corresponding period in 2015: 124 days). The Group is putting in enormous effort toward maintaining a level of lower inventory turnover days. During the period under review, in order to reduce idle inventory and to replenish working capital, certain amount of polysilicon purchased at high prices have been sold. Together with the commission of the additional module manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2016, the proportion of modules and their auxiliary raw materials in stock has increased and the inventory turnover days have improved as a result. For the first half of 2016, the trade receivable turnover days of the Group increased to 70 days (the corresponding period in 2015: 44 days). Generally, the Group allows a credit period of 30 to 90 days for its customers and module sales has a longer credit period than other products. The increase in trade receivable turnover days was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of module sales near the end of the period under review. As a result of stable business development in an upward market, the proportion of module to overall sales has increased, which led to an increase in solar cell purchases. As solar cell purchases usually has a shorter payment term, it led to a decrease in trade payable turnover days during the period under review to 89 days (the corresponding period in 2015: 123 days). During the period under review, module sales has shown substantial growth, the need for working capital increased. The banks saw a steady turnover of trade receivables, and showed their support through increases in facilities. The principal sources of working capital of the Group during the period under review were cash flows from bank borrowings. As at 30 June 2016, the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of the Group was 0.85 (31 December 2015: 0.87). The Group had net borrowings of RMB1,595.649 million as at 30 June 2016 (31 December 2015: RMB1,626.869 million), including cash in bank and on hand of RMB290.478 million (31 December 2015: RMB193.953 million), pledged deposits of RMB294.486 million (31 December 2015: RMB459.171 million), bank loans due within one year of RMB1,872.969 million (31 December 2015: RMB1,931.849 million) and non-current bank and other loans of RMB307.644 million (31 December 2015: RMB348.144 million). The net debt to equity ratio (net debt divided by total equity) was 144.19% (31 December 2015: 129.2%). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the period under review was RMB135.882 million (corresponding period in 2015: RMB170.978 million). As at 30 June 2016, the Group has undertaken to guarantee a bank loan to an associate to the extent of RMB31,820,000 (31 December 2015: RMB37,000,000). As most loan balances are secured by the fixed assets of the associate, the directors consider fair value of the above financial guarantee is insignificant. At the end of the reporting period, the Directors do not consider it probable that a claim will be made against the Group under the above guarantee. The maximum liability of the Group at the end of the reporting period under the above guarantee issued is the outstanding amount of the loan advanced by the bank to the associate of RMB31,820,000. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily arising from sales and purchases and cash and bank deposits that are denominated in a currency other than Renminbi, the functional currency of the operations to which they relate. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollar. The Directors do not expect any significant impact from the change in exchange rates since the Group uses foreign currencies received from customers to settle the amounts due to suppliers. In addition, the Directors ensure that the net exposure is kept at an acceptable level by purchasing or selling the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollar at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances. As at 30 June 2016, the Group had 3,765 (30 June 2015: 3,574) employees. Since 2015, solar market has grown strongly and demand for solar modules has increased significantly. With the continued recovery in the global solar market, expected market demand will continue to rally, the Group expects that earnings will remain stable. In future, the delivery volume of the Group’s module products is expected to increase remarkably and contribute to promising profits of the Group. In future, the Group will adhere to its development strategy of vertical integration. By fully leveraging its technological advantage in monocrystalline products and focusing on the development of monocrystalline products, the Group will be able to make good use of its upstream capacity through growth in module demand, to raise the gross profit of the Group’s module products and to drive profit growth of the Group. As mentioned above, through the expansion of module production capacity in the first half of 2016, it enabled the Group to cope with more orders from the Chinese state-owned enterprises (“SOE”), hence improving the geographical overseas versus local shipment proportion and is approaching a more sustainable balance set out by the management. Future prospects and strategies (continued) By continually uplifting product quality and refining the structure of its full- industry chain businesses, the Group will, as always, provide the best product application development and one-stop services to the customers along its fully integrated photovoltaic industry chain, and aim at becoming a globally leading supplier of one-stop services in solar power generation. The Directors do not recommend the distribution of interim dividend in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2016 (six months ended 30 June 2015: RMB Nil).

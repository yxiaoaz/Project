During the first half of 2016, the long-term trend of “L-shaped” growth of China’s economy continued with a further slowdown in growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew year on year by 6.7%, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage point as compared to the corresponding period of last year, and reached its record low. The growth rate of fixed asset investment continued to slow down and grew year on year by 9%, representing a decrease of 2.4 percentage points as compared to the corresponding period of last year. The growth rate of investment is primarily driven by real estate investment and infrastructure investment. The growth rate of real estate investment and infrastructure investment is 6.2% and 20.3% respectively. The growth rate of the investment in the manufacture industry experienced a sharp decline. Enterprises showed less interest in taking the initiative to make investment. Demand for fixed asset investment from the public also decreased significantly. The growth rate of fixed asset investment fell to 2.8% from 11.4% for the corresponding period of last year, recording its lowest point since the financial crisis in 2008. For the financial environment, the central bank continued its accommodative monetary policy during the first half of the year. The total financing amount across the country increased year on year by RMB961.8 billion to RMB9.75 trillion, among which RMB loans issued to the real economy significantly increased to RMB7.48 trillion, reaching its historical high year on year. Direct financing, especially corporate bonds, increased significantly and also reached its historical high year on year. With the continuous slowdown in the growth rate of China’s economy and further deepening of industrial restructuring, the growth of the tertiary sector continued to outpace that of the secondary sector. In the first half of the year, the added value of the tertiary sector grew by 7.5%, which was 1.4 percentage points higher than that of the secondary sector. The tertiary sector accounted for 54.1% of GDP, which represented a higher proportion again with an increase of 1.8 percentage points as compared to the corresponding period of last year, and was 14.7 percentage points higher than the share of GDP attributed to the secondary sector. In respect of various industries served by Far East Horizon, the development in their environment diversified significantly. Sectors including healthcare, education, urban public utilities and media, the stable industries under the new economic cycle, maintained rapid growth pace with greater demand for fixed asset investment. With a slowdown in the growth of industrial value in China’s infrastructure construction industry, the infrastructure construction industry was facing in- depth structural adjustment. Promotion of new urbanization and upgrade of infrastructure marked the direction of future development. The operating sector, mainly the manufacturing industry, was facing difficulties such as production overcapacity and a shortage of orders in some enterprises. Some industries continued to experience fluctuation and adjustment. Affected by the weak global macroeconomic environment, the shipping market remained sluggish. In the first half of 2016, benefiting from supportive policies and the promotion by local government, the financial leasing industry maintained a rapid development trend. Capital investments and talents from different sectors rushed into the industry. At present, there were a total of 5,708 companies engaging in three types of financial leasing (namely financial leasing, domestic leasing and foreign leasing), representing an increase of 1,200 enterprises or 26.6% as compared to the end of last year. In particular, during the first half of the year, four financial leasing companies obtained approval for establishment and five financial leasing companies commenced operation. With the increase number of leasing companies, there was rapid increase in capital and capital volume of financial leasing industry. The total capital of the industry amounted to RMB1,972.1 billion, representing an increase of 97% as compared to the corresponding period of last year. The balance of financial leasing contracts amounted to RMB4,680.0 billion, representing an increase of 28% as compared to the corresponding period of last year. Amidst continuous macroeconomic downturn, further deepening of industrial restructuring and the rapid growth in the leasing industry, Fast East Horizon strived to the commercial mode of integrating “finance and industry”. It grasped the opportunities arising from economic and industry adjustments, and accelerated its industry and asset deployment for the next economic cycle, thus coping with the trend of economic and industrial adjustment. With regard to the financial business, in response to the diversified industrial trends, Far East Horizon actively adjusted and optimized its industry and asset deployment. On one hand, it expanded the deployment in promising sectors with steady development, such as healthcare, education and urban public utilities. On the other hand, it actively explored new profitable fields under other new economic cycle such as tourism, sports, pharmaceutics and entertainment and media, thus promoting secure and steady business growth. While continuing to expand its business scale, Far East Horizon further enriched its financial product and service portfolio. Focusing on serving quality companies and institutions, Far East Horizon offered product portfolio on leasing, factoring, structural financing, etc., thus enhancing its competitiveness and expanding its customer base. In addition, Far East Horizon implemented strict control over the approval of high risk business fields, minimized risk exposures, and focused on gaining quality customers from different sectors. It also continued to optimize its asset management system and improved its asset management capability. As for the industrial operation business, Far East Horizon facilitated its deployment on three major industries, namely healthcare, infrastructure construction and education, and continued to enhance the operating capability in different sectors. In the first half of 2016, Far East Healthcare entered into agreements to invest or gain control over five additional hospitals through investment, merger and acquisition, as well as reorganization. We invested or gained control over 13 hospitals in total. Focusing on discipline construction and quality of medical care, the Group will improve the operating capabilities and management efficiencies of the hospitals so as to develop them into a leading hospital operation and management group in China. At the same time, the Group has been prudently exploring opportunities to develop in high-end maternal and child healthcare and rehabilitation and geriatric industries, and has entered into agreements with nine hospitals so far. Centering on the infrastructure industry chain, Far East Construction facilitated the deployment of equipment operation and engineering service, and focused on enhancing its capability in respect of equipment services for engineering construction and leasing of high-end scaffolding, as well as increasing its market share. Taking kindergartens and international high schools as starting points, Far East Education entered into agreements in respect of 10 new high-end international kindergarten sites and invested in a new international high school during the first half of the year. At present, we successfully invested and gained control in 13 high-end kindergartens and 2 high-end international high schools. 2.1 Analysis of Profit and Loss (Overview) In the first half of 2016, the Group relied on China’s actual economy and continued to implement its operational philosophy of integrating “finance and industry”, which led to an overall healthy and steady growth in its results.

Income derived from advisory services grew by 36.17% due to the Group’s active efforts in providing comprehensive value-added services encompassing financial management, business operation, management advisory services and others. The Group also accelerated its pace in developing integrated industrial operation business with income derived from industrial operations grew by 57.73% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The table below sets forth the composition and the change of Group’s revenue by business segments in the indicated periods. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Financial services (interest income) Advisory services (fee income) Income (after Business taxes and surcharges) The Group also categorized income by industry, and the Group was mainly engaged in 9 industries covering healthcare, education, infrastructure construction, industrial machinery, packaging, transportation, electronic information, urban public utility and comprehensive development (formerly textiles) for the first half of 2016. Meanwhile, with the promulgation of national macro-control policies and the further promotion of the industrial operation of the Group, the overall income of healthcare, education and infrastructure construction segments increased by 31.04%, 58.68% and 12.49% respectively as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. With the expansion of the industries covered, income of comprehensive development business segment increased by 80.37% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. In January 2016, the Group renamed its textiles segment as comprehensive development segment in order to establish the whole industry chain of basic materials, expand its business and improve its operating capacity in the industry. The table below sets forth the composition and the change of the Group’s income (before business taxes and surcharges) by industry in the indicated periods. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) 2.2.1 Financial Services (Interest Income) The interest income (before business taxes and surcharges) from the financial and advisory segment of the Group rose by 17.77% from RMB3,369,177,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB3,967,770,000 for the first half of 2016, accounting for 53.63% of the Group’s total revenue (before business taxes and surcharges). The table below sets forth the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest income and average yield by industry during the indicated periods.

Interest income of each industry represents the revenue before business taxes and surcharges. Average yield represents the quotient of interest income as divided by average balance of interest-earning assets, on annualized basis. Interest-earning assets include net financial leasing receivable, entrusted loans, mortgage loans, long-term receivables, factoring receivables and respective interest accrued but not received. The average balance of interest-earning assets of the Group increased by 22.31% from RMB104,428,539,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB127,727,235,000 for the first half of 2016. Besides the continuous encouragement from the three major segments, namely healthcare, education and infrastructure construction, there were substantial growth in industrial machinery, comprehensive development and urban public utility for the period, representing an increase of 44.65% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets reflected the business expansion of the Group and its in-depth exploration into each of the industries, as well as the benefits from the Group’s greater efforts in marketing and promotion. In the first half of 2016, the average yield of the Group was 6.21%, representing 0.24 percentage point lower than 6.45% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. This was mainly due to the fact that (i) in the second half of 2015, the People’s Bank of China reduced the benchmark interest rate for two times, which resulted in the benchmark interest rate of Renminbi loans with respective terms of 1 to 5 years decreased by 50 basis points from 5.25% to 4.75%, thus the average asset yield of the Group decreased by approximately 0.30 percentage point. In order to cope with the effect caused by lower interest rate, the Group promoted the business contract with fixed interest rate to some extent to reduce the adverse effect arising from the reduction of benchmark interest rate; (ii) the Group maintained stable yet increasing investment in healthcare, infrastructure construction, education, electronic information application, public transportation, water supply and other highly secured civil industries. The percentage of the assets in civil industries to the total interest-earning assets increased from 65.63% as at the end of the previous year to 74.92% as at the end of the period. At the same time, the Group continuously increased the investments in high-end quality customers and improved the quality of comprehensive financial services, according to the statistics, customers who contributed revenue of more than RMB100 million accounted for 68.48% of the newly contracted customers in the first half of 2016, up by 11.21 percentage points from 57.27% in the first half of 2015. The table below sets forth the breakdown of interest income by region in the indicated periods. (Unaudited) (Unaudited) 2.2.2 Advisory Services (Fee Income) In the first half of 2016, fee income (before business taxes and surcharges) from financial and advisory segment grew by 36.17% from RMB1,937,978,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB2,639,020,000 for the first half of 2016, accounting for 35.68% of the total revenue (before business taxes and surcharges) of the Group and representing an increase as compared with 33.37% in the corresponding period of the previous year. The table below sets forth the Group’s service charge income (before business taxes and surcharges) by industry during the indicated periods. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) Healthcare, education and comprehensive development accounted for the greatest contribution to the aggregate growth of the Group’s service charge income (before business taxes and surcharges). The increase in service charge income of such industries was mainly attributable to: (i) the expansion of scale and scope of services provided to the customers of the Group in view of the diversification of products and services offered in the Group’s advisory services segment and expansion of the Group’s businesses; and (ii) the Group focused on providing service to high quality customers in the industries given the interest rate cut. Infrastructure construction focused on the development of customer base in the infrastructure industries during the period. As the customer base shifted upwards, the service charge income decreased by 2.40% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The table below sets forth the breakdown of the Group’s service charge income (before business taxes and surcharges) by region in the indicated periods. (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenue from industrial operation segment of the Group, before business taxes and surcharges, increased by 57.73% from RMB501,222,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB790,587,000 for the first half of 2016, accounting for 10.69% of the total revenue of the Group (before business taxes and surcharges).

Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenue from industrial operation Including: Revenue from education institution In the first half of 2016, the Group’s equipment operation business development had established a complete preliminary marketing system and the assets scale has joined the front ranks in sub-markets such as engineering equipment and scaffolds. Revenue (before business taxes and surcharges) amounted to RMB284,209,000, accounting for 35.95% of the revenue from industrial operation segment for the year and representing an increase of 26.46% as compared to the same period last year. Continuing to treat hospital investment and operation as its core businesses for the first half of 2016, the Group committed itself to accelerating deployment and gradually built a hospital group featuring advanced technologies and quality service with integrity and safety. During the first half of 2016, the Group entered into agreements to invest or gained control over five hospitals, namely Siyang Chinese Medicine Hospital ( ), Nayong Xinli Hospital ( ), Chongqing Yudong Hospital ( ), Deyang Fifth Hospital ( ) and Fengyang Gulou Hospital ( ), through investment, merger and acquisition, as well as reorganization. We invested or gained control over 13 hospitals in total with over 5,000 beds available. According to the operation needs of the hospitals, nearly 3,500 beds were actually in use as at the end of June 2016. Revenue from hospital operation amounted to RMB235,578,000 for the first half of the year. Focusing on discipline construction and quality of medical care, the Group will improve the operating capabilities and management efficiencies of the hospitals as well as keep on expanding the scale of the medical group so as to develop into a leading hospital operation and management group in China. The Group began its systematic deployment in the education industry in 2015. In 2016, the Group committed to the establishment of high-end kindergartens and expanded the layout of first-class international education at home and abroad. The Group entered into agreements in respect of 10 new high-end kindergarten sites in Shanghai and other four cities during the first half of the year. Together with the three kindergartens acquired in 2015, the Group had 13 kindergartens in total. The Group also acquired an international school in China. The investment project of a British international school was almost completed. As at 30 June 2016, the Group operated 3 high-end kindergartens and 2 international schools with more than 800 students, representing an increase of 41% as compared to last year. Revenue amounted to RMB50,546,000 for the first half of the year. Cost of sales of the Group for the first half of 2016 was RMB2,566,867,000, representing an increase of 12.81% from RMB2,275,474,000 in the corresponding period of the previous year. This was mainly due to an increase in the cost of the industrial operation segment as a result of its expansion in scale. Among them, the cost of the financial and advisory segment was RMB1,940,820,000, accounting for 75.61% of the total cost. The cost of the industrial operation segment was RMB626,047,000, accounting for 24.39% of the total cost. The table below sets forth the composition and the change of the Group’s cost of sales by business segments during the indicated periods. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Cost of the leasing, factoring and Cost of the industrial operation The cost of sales of the financial and advisory segment of the Group comprised solely of the relevant interest expenses of the interest-bearing bank and other financing of the Group.

The cost of sales of financial and advisory segment increased from RMB1,938,898,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB1,940,820,000 for the first half of 2016. The average cost rate of the Group was 4.40% for the first half of 2016, representing a decrease as compared to the first half of 2015. It is mainly due to the fact that: (i) with the advance of the Group’s diversified financing strategy, the Group worked hard on the diversification of low-cost direct financing products including corporate bonds, short-term financial bonds and medium term notes, thereby reducing the financial cost of the Company; (ii) the proportion of sell-out ABS assets in the balance sheet increased for the first half of the year, and thus the financial expenses was effectively reduced; and (iii) the Group’s liabilities balance at floating rates accounted for more than 50%. The effect of the interest rate cuts for five times by the central bank of China in 2015 began to be reflected in the reduction of financial expenses in 2016. In the second half of 2016, the Group will continue to optimize its liability structure and effectively control its finance costs. Our major measures are as follows: (i) the Group will actively participate in off-balance sheet activities; (ii) the Group will continue to expand the proportion of domestic direct financing and plan to promote corporate bonds, short-term financial bonds and other low-cost direct financing products to reduce financial costs while enriching financing products; and (iii) in traditional bank financing, the Group will withdrawal more low-cost funds to replace part of high-cost financing. The cost of sales of industrial operation segment of the Group is primarily derived from the cost of operating lease, cost of hospital operation and cost of education institution operation etc. The following table sets forth the cost of industrial operating segments of the Group by business type of the period indicated. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Cost of the industrial operation Of which: Cost of education institution Cost of operating lease of the Group increased by 96.70% to RMB230,605,000 in the first half of 2016 from RMB117,237,000 in the first half of 2015 mainly due to the addition in the leased assets resulting from the rapid growth of the operating leasing business of the Group. In the first half of 2016, with the accelerate of mergers and acquisitions of hospitals and the addition in operating hospitals, cost of hospital operation increased by 281.92% to RMB165,620,000 in the first half of 2016 from RMB43,365,000 in the first half of 2015. In the first half of 2016, with the commencement of operation of high-end kindergartens and first-class international schools, the Group needed to hire good domestic and foreign teachers, and thus most of the cost was labor cost while the remaining costs were housing rentals and amortization of renovation expenses etc. The gross profit of the Group for the first half of 2016 increased by RMB1,229,706,000 or 35.29% to RMB4,713,800,000 from RMB3,484,094,000 in the corresponding period of the previous year. For the first half of 2016 and 2015, the gross profit margin of the Group was 64.74% and 60.49%, respectively. The gross profit margin of the financial and advisory segment of the Group for the first half of 2016 was 70.62%, up from 63.47% in the same period last year. The gross profit margin of the financial and advisory segment was affected by the change of net interest income and net interest margin. The following table sets forth the interest income, interest expense, net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin for the periods indicated. Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Interest income(1) Interest expense(2) Net interest spread(3) Net interest margin(4) Notes: Interest income is the interest income of the financial and advisory segment of the Group. Interest expense is the borrowing cost of the financial and advisory segment of the Group. Calculated as the difference between the average yield and the average cost. The average yield is calculated by dividing interest income by the average total balance of interest-earning assets. The average cost rate is calculated by dividing interest expense by the average total balance of the interest-bearing liabilities. Calculated by dividing net interest income by the average total balance of interest-earning assets. Net interest spread of the Group for the first half of 2016 increased by 0.37 percentage point to 1.81% as compared with 1.44% for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase in net interest spread was primarily due to the decrease of 24 basis points in the average yield on interest-earning assets of the Group and the decrease of 61 basis points in respect of the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of the Group. For the changes in respect of the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost rate on interest bearing liabilities, please refer to the discussion and analysis in paragraphs 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 of this section. At the same time, the net interest income of the Group increased by 41.72% to RMB2,026,950,000 for the first half of 2016 from RMB1,430,279,000 for the first half of 2015, and the average balance of interest-earning assets of the Group increased by 22.31% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Based on the above-mentioned reasons, the net interest margin of the Group increased by 0.43 percentage point to 3.17% as compared with 2.74% for the corresponding period of the previous year. The gross profit of the industrial operation segment remained steady at RMB164,540,000 during the first half of 2016 as compared with RMB164,646,000 for the first half of 2015. Among which, the gross profit of the operating leasing business and the hospital operation were RMB53,604,000 and RMB69,958,000 respectively, accounting for 32.58% and 42.52% of the total gross profit of the industrial operation segment. During the first half of 2016, due to the acceleration in merger and acquisition of hospitals and the increase in number of hospitals in operation, the gross profit of the hospital operation increased by 283.92% from RMB18,222,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB69,958,000 for the first half of 2016. During the first half of 2016, the gross profit of the education institution operation was RMB20,079,000, with gross profit margin of approximately 40%. Recently, two kindergartens and one international school have fulfilled their enrolment quota and the remaining one kindergarten and one international school have not fulfilled their enrolment quota. Housing rental expenses and amortization of renovation expenses were fixed costs, and thus the gross profit is expected to further increase after all kindergartens and international schools fulfilled their enrolment quota. The gross profit of operating leasing decreased by 50.14% from RMB107,514,000 for the first half of 2015 to RMB53,604,000 for the first half of 2016, mainly due to the prudent recognition of revenue of operating leasing by the Group as a result of slowdown in construction progress. The Group will further strengthen the asset allocation of the industry so as to accelerate the growth of gross profit.

Specifically, these unpaid taxes include the business tax and additional effects that have been accrued based on the interest expenses. In the first half of 2016, the Group’s other income and gains amounted to RMB144,238,000, representing a decrease of 27.76% from the corresponding period of the previous year, mainly attributable to the decreases in foreign exchange gains and government grants. The Group’s other income increased by 1,334.32% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, mainly attributable to the increase of RMB11,740,000 in gains from subordinated tranches of asset-backed securities issued by the Group as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Selling and distribution costs of the Group in the first half of 2016 amounted to RMB974,218,000, which increased by RM305,191,000 or 45.62% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.

The change in administrative expenses was mainly due to: (i) the increase in expenses relating to the impairment of loans and accounts receivable (impairment of loans and accounts receivable in the first half of 2016 amounted to RMB880,633,000, representing an increase of RMB480,314,000 or 119.98% from the corresponding period of the previous year); and (ii) the cost regarding the remuneration and welfare of staff relating to the administrative expenses increased by RMB238,135,000 or 83.63% from the corresponding period of the previous year, which was due to the effectively control of the costs by the Group in light of the increase in the headcount of fulltime staff. The total headcount of full-time staff of the Group increased from 5,266 in the first half 2015 to 7,036 in the first half of 2016. Cost to income ratio of the Group in the first half of 2016 was 35.61%, which was higher as compared with 32.15% of the corresponding period of the previous year.

The following table sets forth the analysis of loans and accounts receivable as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Other net interest-earning assets(1) Others(2) Subtotal for loans and accounts Notes: Other interest-earning assets include entrusted loans, mortgage loans, long term receivables and factoring receivables, as well as their respective interest accrued but not received. Others include notes receivables and accounts receivables. Net interest-earning assets of the Group as of 30 June 2016 were RMB133,483,992,000, representing an increase of 9.44% as compared with RMB121,970,478,000 as of 31 December 2015. The increase was due to a steady increase in both the number of customers served and the number of new contracts entered into by the Group, as a result of the continuous expansion of financial business of the Group on a basis of the Group’s effective risk control in the first half of 2016. The following table sets forth net interest-earning assets(1) of the Group by industry as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) Note: Net interest-earning assets for healthcare and education as of 30 June 2016 grew the most in amount among the target industries of the Group, namely by RMB4,063,109,000 and RMB2,997,910,000, respectively over those as at 31 December 2015. The increase was attributable to the business expansion and exploration in different industries, as well as contribution from enhanced promotion and marketing activities. Furthermore, the Group, in order to adapt to the market environment, made strategic moves to reduce allocation to certain sluggish industries, which led to lower growth rates for transportation and packaging. The table below sets forth net interest-earning assets(1) of the Group by region as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) The following table sets forth an aged analysis of net interest-earning assets as of the dates indicated, categorized by the time elapsed since the effective date of the relevant leases, entrusted loans, mortgage loans, credit assignment a and factoring contracts. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Net interests-earning assets within one year represent net interest-earning assets the Group received, and are still valid as of the end of the year or the end of the period. As of 30 June 2016, net interest-earning assets within one year as set out in the table above represented 59.67% of net interest-earning assets of the Group. The following table sets forth, as of the dates indicated, the maturity profile of the net interest-earning assets. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Net interest-earning assets due within one year represent net interest-earning assets which the Group will receive within one year of the reporting date indicated. As of 30 June 2016, net interest-earning assets due within one year as set forth in the table above represented 37.97% of the Group’s net interest-earning assets as of each of the respective dates, which was flat as compared to the end of the previous year. This indicated that the maturity of the Group’s net financial leasing receivable was widely spread and could provide the Group with consistent and sustainable cash inflows that facilitated the matching of our liabilities. The Group implements a five-category classification of interest-earning assets that accurately reveal the asset risk profile and confirm the quality of assets primarily by obtaining information on the qualification of stock and assets. On such basis, we have deployed management resources and efforts in a focused manner to effectively implement measures on category management, and have strengthened risk anticipation and the relevance of risk prevention to improve the ability to control asset risks. In determining the classification of our interest-earning assets portfolio, we apply a series of criteria that are derived from our own internal regulations regarding the management of lease assets. These criteria are designed to assess the likelihood of repayment by the borrower and the collect ability of principal and interest on our interest-earning assets. Our interest-earning assets classification criteria focus on a number of factors, if applicable; and our asset classifications include: Pass. There is no reason to doubt that the loan principal and interest will not be paid by the debtor in full and/or on a timely basis. There is no reason whatsoever to suspect that the interest-earning assets will be impaired. Special mention. Even though the debtor has been able to pay his payments in a timely manner, there are still factors that could adversely affect its ability to pay, which are related to changes in the economic, policy and industrial environment, the structure of the debtor’s property rights and the debtor’s management mechanisms, organizational framework and management personnel adjustments, operating capabilities, material investments and credit size and conditions, as well as the impact of changes in the value of core assets on the debtor’s ability to repay; while taking into consideration the impact of subjective factors, including any change in the debtor’s willingness to repay, on the quality of assets, such as if payments have been overdue for 30 days or more, then the interest-earning assets for this contract shall be classified as special mention or lower. Substandard. The debtor’s ability to pay is in question as it is unable to make its payments in full with its operating revenues, and we are likely to incur losses notwithstanding the enforcement of any guarantees underlying the contract. We take into account other factors, for example, if lease payments have been overdue for over three months, then the interest-earning assets for this contract shall be classified as substandard or lower. Doubtful. The debtor’s ability to pay is in question as it is unable to make payments in full and/or on a timely basis with its operating revenues and we are likely to incur significant losses notwithstanding the enforcement of any guarantees underlying the contract. We take into account other factors, for example, if payments have been overdue for over six months, the interest-earning assets for this contract shall be classified as doubtful or lower. Loss. After taking all possible steps or going through all necessary legal procedures, payments remain overdue or only a very limited portion has been recovered. We take into account other factors, for example, if payments have been overdue for more than one year, the interest-earning assets for this contract shall be classified as a loss. In the first half of 2016, although the overall economic growth rate stayed in a reasonable range based on conditions of the external environment, international situations remained complicated and grim while the domestic economy was still changing gear and restructuring, facing enormous downward pressure as new uncertainties emerged undermining its weak footing. The operating environment faced by some of our customers did not turned around. There were challenges in the safety of present stock assets. The Group continued to optimize its asset allocation, strengthen its risk evaluation and asset process monitoring, and intensify risk asset disposal so as to keep the quality of our assets stable and under control on the whole during the reporting period. In the first half of 2016, the Group continued with differentiated allotment of credit resources towards the four categories of investment, namely the encouraged, the maintained, the restricted and the reduced. In particular, allotments to low-risk sectors such as healthcare, education and public utility were amplified, and those to the restricted and the reduced category including vessels, paper-making and machinery manufacture were diminished. While cutting credit facilities to customers with deteriorating operation amid the economic downturn, the strategy to move group customers up was followed such that an more active approach was adopted towards state-owned groups and listed ones and credit lines for them rose to the drawing up near the safety margin. In the first half of 2016, the Group conducted a centralized evaluation on assets associated with industries closely related to the inventory reduction reform on the supply side and with customers with heavy liabilities such as those related to coal, textile and cement for the purpose of ascertaining total assets and ensuring their safety through specific and stringent control. Furthermore, in coping with impacts of uncertainties in external economic and financial environment, the Group adjusted its credit policies so that further control may be exercised over the approval process and mitigating measures. In order to ensure the effective execution of such policies, self-assessment and correction were required of every division and department so that the policies would be able to achieve goals established. In the first half of 2016, the Group continued to vigorously advance the local construction of asset management, the expansion of taskforces for local asset management and the optimization of regional-level plans across the country, so that customer coverage was further extended and the efficiency and effectiveness of asset monitoring were improved. In the first half of 2016, the Group continued to promote the construction of internet monitoring system and carry out the complete and uninterrupted information monitoring through introducing new network risk information monitoring tools to monitor real-time irregularities of customers and enhance efficiency. In the first half of 2016, the Group kept improving on its management of leased items and collateral. It introduced an independent and complete targeting process for accepting, changing and evaluating leased items and collateral, thereby implemented systematic management thereof and boosted the efficiency of accepting projects and effectiveness of subsequent management. In the first half of 2016, the Group continued to optimize the management mechanism on risk assets disposal and expand the disposal resources and methods, thereby effectively mitigated risks. With respect to management mechanisms, centralized support was provided for litigation handling to enhance efficiency. With respect to disposal resources, disposal channels such as the judiciary, law firms and equipment disposal companies were continuously expanded to elevate the network across the country. The following table sets forth the five-category interest-earning assets classification as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) The Group has established prudent asset quality control and adhered to a stringent and conservative asset classification policy. As of 30 June 2016, the Group’s assets under special mention accounted for 12.09% of its net interest-earning assets, representing a slight decrease as compared with that of 12.42% at the end of the previous year. In particular, assets under special mention in the transportation industry accounted for the largest portion at 24.97%, mainly attributable to the protracted over-capacity in the market and the resulting pressure on rates during the first half of 2016. The Group prudently kept the assets in this sector under ongoing supervision, as the Group paid close attention to the systematic risks of such industry. The assets under special mention in the healthcare industry accounted for the second largest portion at 17.33%, mainly attributable to the large investment of the infrastructure of the some healthcare segments with high debts, causing pressure of inelastic payment. The Group prudently kept this asset class under ongoing supervision. Assets under special mention in the machinery industry accounted for the third largest portion at 13.11%, mainly attributable to the over-capacity and low demand in certain segments of the machine manufacturing industry, causing a significant decline in profits, in view of the impact of the prolonged macro-economic downturn, and thus the Group prudently reclassified more assets in this sector as assets under special mention. The assets under special mention in the packaging industry accounted for the fourth largest portion at 12.20%, mainly attributable to the fact that the packaging industry has yet to see a decided turnaround and certain SME clients were met with severe setback due to their low industry risk resistance and fell into arrears with tight liquidity. Therefore, the Group prudently reclassified more assets In the interest of prudence, the Group also took into account any adverse effect of rent repayment schedules of clients in addition to payments overdue. For example, underlying assets of pioneering industries were kept under special mention during the relevant industries were under observation; those of high risk projects were kept under special mention for a certain period; those of industries with over-capacity subject to the macro-economy were under constant special mention; those of certain clients with concern-raising factors eliminated or better operations were kept under special mention during the observation period for their tight rent repayment schedules or any uncertainties likely to emerge. Based on the above bases for categorization, appropriately 90% assets under special mention were not overdue as at the end of the reporting period, of which 37.56% had been in this category for over a year. The following table sets forth the analysis on the Group’s assets under special mention by industry for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the migration of the Group’s assets under special mention for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) The Group’s asset quality remained favourable. The non-performing asset ratio slightly increased from 0.97% from the end of the previous year to 1.01% as of 30 June 2016. The non-performing asset ratio for the transportation industry to total non-performing assets was 36.48%, mainly because certain clients remained to operate at breakeven and consumed substantially their liquidity under the prolonged downturn in the shipping market. The Group prudently reclassified the assets of the segment into substandard and doubtful assets. The non-performing asset ratio for the packaging industry to total non-performing assets was 23.41%, primarily because the Group prudently reclassified the assets of the segment into substandard and doubtful assets in view of deteriorated creditworthiness of clients in the industry upon the outbreak of withdrawal of loan grants from banks and enforcement of mutual guarantees, in particular clients in the printing industry who were continually distressed by insufficient liquidity in segments experiencing lasting over-capacity, fierce competition and longer turnover of receivables. The non-performing assets of the industrial machinery accounted for 14.57% of the total non-performing assets. Due to the overall structural imbalances and low-end capacity of segments such as engineering machinery and machine tools, the revenue and profit of certain customers plummeted. The Group prudently reclassified more assets of the machinery industry into substandard and doubtful assets. The non-performing assets of the infrastructure construction industry accounted for 15.12% of the total non-performing assets, mainly because of the decrease in state fixed assets investment and over-capacity in related industries such as coal, steel and cement, resulting in deteriorated operations of certain customers in this category. Hence, the Group prudently reclassified more assets of the segment into substandard and doubtful assets. The following table sets forth the analysis on the Group’s non-performing assets by industry for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the analysis on the Group’s substandard assets by industry for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the analysis on the Group’s doubtful assets by industry for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 % of total% (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the analysis on the Group’s loss assets by industry for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the movement of non-performing assets of the Group for the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 Downgrades(1) Note: Represents downgrades of interest-earning assets classified as normal or special mention at the end of prior year and interest-earning assets newly classified in the current period to non-performing categories. The following table sets forth the analysis of the Group’s provisions under the assessment methodology as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) The following table sets forth the write-offs of interest-earning assets as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Non-performing assets as at the end of the previous Write-off ratio(1) Note: The write-off ratio is calculated as the percentage of bad debts of interest-earning assets write-offs over net of non-performing assets as of the beginning of the relevant year. In the first half of 2016, the Group wrote off bad debts of RMB144,836,000 mainly for transportation, packaging and infrastructure construction, which accounted for RMB62,629,000, RMB40,246,000 and RMB25,430,000 respectively. This was mainly because of the disruption of capital chain due to the lasting loss of shippers under the prolonged downturn in the shipping market and of the low ship prices which did not cover risk exposure of projects. On the other hand, the as affected by the external economic environment, certain SME customers were hit by their weak resistance against industry risk and experienced setbacks in their operations, triggering frequent risks associated to interconnection and mutual insurance of companies and a slump in corporate assets. Despite its effort in collection through judicial means, exercisable assets were unable to cover risk exposure of projects. 3.2.6.4 Status of Interest-earning Assets (Over 30 Days) The following table sets forth status of interest-earning assets (over 30 days) as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Audited) (Audited) Overdue ratio (over 30 days) As a result of the Group’s prudent risk control and asset management, the Group’s lease overdue ratio (over 30 days) was 1.08% during the first half of 2016, which remained stable as compared with the end of 2015. The following table sets forth status of interest-earning assets (overdue more than 30 days) by industry as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) Comprehensive development (formerly textiles) The following table sets forth the classification of interest-earning assets (overdue more than 30 days) as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) The assets under special mention that were overdue more than 30 days mostly fell into the transportation and infrastructure construction industries, of which, the transportation industry accounted for 65.90% while the infrastructure construction industry accounted for 19.13%. In recent years, there were stagnant markets in the transportation industries. With the imbalanced supply and demand, shippers lacked bargaining power against goods owners and turnover period of accounts receivable was extended, leading to financial strains of certain of them. As for infrastructure construction, investment in fixed assets slowed down and certain construction companies experienced a decrease in business and financial strains at points of time. The Group continued to prudently pay attention to the above tense capital arrangements at points of time. On 30 June 2016, cash and cash equivalents of the Group amounted to RMB620,172,000. The Group started to reserve relatively sufficient cash to sustain the business development and ensure the capital liquidity safety of the Group. Restricted deposits of the Group amounted to RMB2,603,200,000, which mainly comprised restricted security deposits. Property, plant and equipment of the Group amounted to RMB4,146,174,000, comprised mainly of equipment and instruments for operating leasing and plants and medical equipment of subsidiary hospitals. Prepayments and other receivables of the Group amounted to RMB2,910,153,000, comprised mainly of prepayments for suppliers of machinery and equipment and the secondary share of securitized asset products of the Group being held. Deferred tax assets of the Group amounted to RMB1,644,008,000, mainly recognized for tax loss. Investment in associates of the Group amounted to RMB1,473,299,000, comprised mainly of equity investments in Guangzhou Kangda, Weihai Haida Hospital and Kunming Broadhealthcare. Assets with continuing involvement of the Group amounted to RMB1,307,874,000, representing an increase of RMB738,812,000 or 129.83% from the end of last year and due to the expansion of its asset securitization during the period. Pursuant to specific requirements of accounting standards, the Group should continue to recognise assets and liabilities with continuing involvement in relation to such activities due to risk associated with subordinate and enhanced credit facilities held by the Group. Prepaid lease payments and other receivables of the Group amounted to RMB1,157,225,000, comprised mainly of those for the land use right for the construction of its main office building acquired in 2013. The balance of the Group’s goodwill amounted to RMB524,098,000, which was mainly the goodwill recognized for the acquisition of six medical and five educational institutions. Liabilities (Overview) On 30 June 2016, total liabilities of the Group amounted to RMB127,022,536,000, representing an increase of RMB10,671,067,000 or 9.17% as compared to the end of last year. Interest-bearing bank and other borrowings were the main component of the Group’s liabilities, accounting for 73.24% of the total, which represented an increase as compared with 71.70% as of the end of last year. The following table sets forth the liability analysis as of the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Interest-bearing bank and other In the first half of 2016, as the complex financial environment at home and overseas faced the Group, the Group made good progress in both indirect financing and direct financing with an improved liability structure, thus obviously enjoying a finance cost advantage over the peers. Within the marketplace of direct financing, the Group further enriched the bond portfolios at home in the first half of the year to form basically the continued issue trend. Corporate bonds, PPNs, ultrashort financing bills and short financing bills issued amounted to RMB7.0 billion, RMB4.0 billion, RMB2.0 billion and RMB2.0 billion respectively. Within the marketplace of indirect financing, the Group achieved cross-platform facility on the basis of the current financing channel as required by its strategic development, and strengthened its co-operation relationship with key bank channels at the same time. In the marketplace, the credit facility with main cooperative banks was further expanded, and the strategic cooperation with them was also further strengthened. Reasonable layouts were set for products in syndicated loans, bilateral loans, factoring and other types. In terms of off-balance-sheet financing, the Group achieved the breakthrough in quantity in 2016, which enabled us to be the most active financial leasing company with the issue of asset-backed securities products in China. Off-balance-sheet financing diversified funding sources, optimized liability structure and improved management on financial statements. Meanwhile, in the situation that the off-balance-sheet financing cost had been continuously reducing, thus vigorously promoting ABS, while the first asset-back notes (ABN) on trust was registered in the first half of the year at an issue size of RMB2.068 billion. Currently, the Group is fully equipped with the continuous and effective issue ability, enabling it to establish the market standard, solidify the project model and set up the image of a mature issuer in the capital market. In conclusion, the Group had diverse financing methods with an improved liability structure, thus further reducing our reliability on a single product and a single market, and in turn achieving diversity of financing products, decentralization of financing regions and the long term finance. The Group was confident that with the global financing network as well as resource advantage, the Group can further improve its competitiveness in the liability landscape. As of 30 June 2016, the total sum of the Group’s interest-bearing bank and other borrowings amounted to RMB93,025,113,000, representing an increase of 11.50% as compared with RMB83,428,801,000 as of the end of last year, mainly due to the increase in the interest-bearing liability resulting from supporting the Group’s expanding our business operations. The Group’s borrowings were mainly denominated in RMB and USD.

The following table sets forth the analysis of equity as at the dates indicated. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 Change % (Unaudited) (Audited) Equity attributable to ordinary Change % (Unaudited) (Unaudited) As at 30 June 2016, the Group had net cash outflow from operating activities in the amount of RMB9,826,399,000, representing a significantly increase from the corresponding period of last year, which was mainly due to the an additional outflow of approximately RMB5.0 billion resulting from increased loans and receivables under business expansion and a significant increase in payables of approximately RMB3.0 billion in the first half of 2016. Correspondingly, the Group increased its bank and other borrowings in financing activities.

The following table sets forth the ratio of assets at risk to equity as of the dates indicated: International Far Eastern Leasing Co., Ltd. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) Far East Horizon (Tianjin) Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) The Group’s capital expenditure was RMB1,342,348,000 in the first half of 2016, which was mainly used as the expenditures for additions of land property, plant and equipment, and external equity investments. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing bank and other borrowings and lease receivables, factoring receivables. A principal part of the Group’s management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modelling). The Group aims to mitigate the impact of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while balancing the cost of such risk measures to mitigate such risk. For leasing and factoring business, the Group vigorously encourages to promote fixed rate products. Through the efforts made in the first half year of 2016, the proportion of fixed rate products of the Group increased largely from 25.92% at the end of 2015 to 37.55% as at 30 June 2016, thus further narrowed down risk exposure. The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rate, to the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity of the profit before tax is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on profit before tax, based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at the end of each reporting period subject to re-pricing within the coming year. 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange relates primarily to the operating activities of the Group (when receipt or payment is settled using a currency that is different from the functional currency). The Group conducts its businesses mainly in RMB, with certain transactions denominated in US$, and to a lesser extent, other currencies. The Group’s exposure mainly arises from its transactions in currencies other than RMB. Furthermore, the Company provides intra-group loans to members of the Group in US$, which may have different measurements under different accounting standards basing on different functional currencies and lead to additional translation differences in consolidated statements of profit and loss of the Group. The table below demonstrates the effect of reasonable potential changes in exchanges rates of US$ and HK$ against RMB arising from actual exposure to foreign exchange risk (excluding senior perpetual securities) and accounting treatments of such intra-group loans, with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s profit before tax (including exchange gain or loss on other comprehensive income to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods). Change in 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) US$ and HK$ – actual exposure to foreign exchange risk (excluding senior perpetual securities) With respect to actual exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group seeks to minimise its net foreign currency position and at the same time adopt financial instruments such as forward exchange rates and currency swaps for hedging purposes. According to relevant statistics, as of 30 June 2016, the Group’s actual exposure to foreign exchange risk (including senior perpetual securities) approximately amounted to US$2,666 million, hedges against foreign exchange exposure amounted to US$2,499 million or 94% (percentage of the aforesaid two items). Thus, the Group’s actual exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited. The table below demonstrates the effect of reasonable potential changes in exchanges rates of US$ and HK$ against RMB arising from actual exposure to foreign exchange risk (including senior perpetual securities), with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s equity interest. Change in 30 June 2016 31 December 2015 (Unaudited) (Audited) US$ and HK$ – actual exposure to foreign exchange risk (excluding senior perpetual securities) US$ – senior perpetual securities (when being redeemed) The effect above was based on the assumption that the Group’s foreign exchange exposures as of the end of each reporting period are kept unchanged and the average percentage of foreign exchange exposure with hedges remained as above so as to calculate the effect of exchange rate change on profit before tax. Liquidity risk is the risk that funds will not be available to meet liabilities as they fall due. This may arise from mismatches in amounts or duration with regard to the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages its liquidity risk through daily monitoring with the following objectives: maintaining the stability of the leasing business, projecting cash flows and evaluating the level of current assets, and maintaining an efficient internal fund transfer mechanism to ensure liquidity of the Group.

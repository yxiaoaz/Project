The Group has reported a decrease in turnover and profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 when compared to the six months ended 30 June 2015. Such decease was mainly due to the one-off and non-recurrent gain on the disposal of Jiangsu Shuntai Packaging & Printing Science Technology Co., Ltd., a then subsidiary of the Company, during the six months ended 30 June 2015 and the absence of such disposal and one-off gain during the six months ended 30 June 2016. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have impacted our reported results. The Group was originally a packaging materials manufacturer in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) upon the listing of its shares on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the "Stock Exchange") in 2012. Since then, the Group has been making significant effort in expanding its business to different sectors. The Group had explored new opportunities in property development and photovoltaic power market in 2014 and 2015 respectively. On 30 June 2016, the Group has completed the acquisition of a cloud-related business and commences to engage in the cloud computing industry. The cloud industry in the PRC is still in the development stage. In order to grasp the opportunity, the Group has purchased 15 data centers which are equipped with cloud technology. The Acquisition has provided an entrance for the Group to enter into the cloud industry. In the future, the Group will continue to leverage on its existing advantage and embark on business transformation with the aim to seize the development opportunities emerging from favorable policies and ultimately achieve rapid growth. After the commencement of operation of our two photovoltaic power stations since late 2015 and mid-2016, and the engagement in cloud- related business since 30 June 2016, the Group has reclassified its existing business into five segments, namely, (i) manufacturing and sales of BOPP film (comprising self-manufactured cigarette film and self-manufactured non-cigarette-related films), (ii) sales of sub- processing cigarette films (comprising anti-counterfeiting cigarette films and slitting imported film), (iii) development of properties, (iv) generation of photovoltaic power, and (v) cloud-related business. During the first six months of 2016, the Group has made sales to (i) cigarette manufacturers; (ii) other customers of cigarette films; (iii) customers of non-cigarette-related packaging materials; (iv) electrical company in Xuzhou, the PRC. No sale has been recorded for sales of properties for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The Group has two factories which are located in (i) Huai’an City in Jiangsu Province, accommodating production facilities for the manufacturing of anti-counterfeiting cigarette films: (ii) Qingdao City in Shandong Province, accommodating production facilities for the manufacturing of BOPP films. The site for property development is located in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, the PRC and is under pre-sales since early 2016, and is expected to generate profit in early 2017. The Group has two photovoltaic power stations located in Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province, which have commenced operation since 28 December 2015 and 25 June 2016 respectively. After the completion of the acquisition of the cloud-related business on 30 June 2016, the Group has 15 data centers located in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Chongqing, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. To oversee the operation of the new cloud business, the Group has reviewed and enhanced the existing human resources by employment of personnel with relevant experiences. The principal activities of the Group include manufacturing and sales of BOPP films, sales of sub-processing cigarette films, development of properties, generation of photovoltaic power and cloud-related business. Our turnover represents the sales value of goods sold less returns, discounts and value added taxes and other sales taxes. For the six months period ended 30 June 2016, our turnover decreased by approximately HK$32.0 million, or approximately 15.0%, from approximately HK$213.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$181.7 million, primarily as a result of the following: Turnover (HK$'000) Total Total The decrease in turnover from sales of BOPP films by approximately 26.6%, from approximately HK$154.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$113.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016, was primarily due to the decrease in the average selling price of our self-manufacturing cigarette- related BOPP films by approximately 9.4% when compared to the six months ended 30 June 2015. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in the sales of our non-cigarette-related films by approximately 12.0%, from approximately HK$46.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$52.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. It is primarily due to the increase in utilization of our second production line in Qingdao factory (which was put into production since late December 2014) and increase in sales forces to enlarge the non-cigarette market share which resulted in an increase of sales volume in our non-cigarette-related films by approximately 42.5%. However, due to the continuously depressed crude oil price, the average selling price of our non-cigarette-related films has decreased by approximately 12.9% when compared to six months ended 30 June 2015. The decrease in turnover from sales of sub-processing cigarette films was mainly due to the decrease in the sales of our slitting imported cigarette films by approximately 25.8%, from approximately HK$29.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$22.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The decrease was partially offset by the increase of the sales of our anti-counterfeiting cigarette films by approximately 14.4%, from approximately HK$29.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$33.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which was primarily due to the increase of demand from our customers. Total The pre-sales of the Xuzhou property project has commenced since 6 March 2016. Profit is expected to be realized in 2017. As at 30 June 2016, around 51% of the properties has completed the pre-sales stage. As at 30 June 2016, the Group had two photovoltaic power stations in operation, with a total grid-connected capacity of 30 megawatts (“MW”). Among them, one was put into operation since 28 December 2015 and the other has commenced operation since 25 June 2016. The revenue generated, including the sales of electricity and the tariff adjustments, amounted to approximately HK$ 12.7 million for the six month ended 30 June 2016. The Group acquired 15 cloud data centers on 30 June 2016. No profit has been derived from the cloud-related business for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Our cost of sales decreased by approximately HK$39.6 million, or approximately 25.4% from approximately HK$156.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$116.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016, which was generally in line with the decrease in our revenue. Our gross profit increased by approximately HK$7.6 million, or approximately 13.2%, from approximately HK$57.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$65.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Our gross profit margin increased from approximately 27.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately 36.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The increase was mainly due to the commencement of our photovoltaic power stations during the six months ended 30 June 2016 which recorded profit margin of approximately 65.7%. Total Gross profit (HK$’000) Our other income recorded a decrease of approximately HK$10.0 million when compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to a loss on trading of securities of approximately HK$2.2 million (six month ended 30 June 2015: gain of approximately HK$2.9 million), and a loss on the revaluation of a convertible bond of approximately HK$3.1 million (six month ended 30 June 2015: gain of approximately HK$1.0 million.) Our selling and distribution expenses increased by approximately HK$9.2 million, or approximately 137.3%, from approximately HK$6.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$15.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The increase was mainly due to the increase in the advertising and selling personnel expenses of the property development segment of the Group. The advertising expenses and personnel expenses related to the property development amounted to approximately HK$ 6.9 million and HK$0.5 million respectively. The Xuzhou property project has commenced pre- sales stage since 6 March 2016 and the advertising campaign has been kicked off since the opening of the year 2016. Our administrative expenses decreased by approximately HK$1.9 million, or approximately 4.9%, from approximately HK$39.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$37.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016, primarily due to the absence of performance bonus for senior management for the first half year of 2016 (for the six months ended 30 June 2015: approximately HK$4.1 million). Our finance costs decreased by approximately 32.2% from approximately HK$8.7 million for the six month ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$5.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016, primarily due to the decrease of interest expenses . Our income tax decreased by approximately HK$38.6 million from approximately HK$45.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to approximately HK$7.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The difference was primarily due to the tax in the amount of approximately HK$ 36.7 million generated from the disposal of our cigarette paper box business in 2015 and the absence of such tax in As a result of the foregoing factors, profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 decreased by approximately HK$331.4 million to approximately HK$0.1 million. Such decrease was mainly due to the one-off and non-recurrent gain on the disposal of Jiangsu Shuntai Packaging & Printing Science Technology Co., Ltd., a then subsidiary of the Company, during the six months ended 30 June 2015 and the absence of such disposal and one-off gain during the six months ended 30 June 2016. Other than that, the decrease was mainly due to the increase of selling and administrative expenses incurred by our property development segment for 2016. As at 30 June 2016, the cash and cash equivalents of the Group amounted to approximately HK$305.9 million (which were denominated in HKD, RMB and USD) compared with approximately HK$194.4 million as at 31 December 2015. For the six months ended 30 June 2016, the Group’s net cash inflow of operating activities, net cash outflow of investment activities and net cash outflow of financing activities amounted to approximately HK$367.8 million, HK$175.1 million and HK$74.8 million respectively. Total interest-bearing borrowings of the Group as at 30 June 2016 was approximately HK$295.7 million (31 December 2015: approximately HK$303.3 million) which were denominated in RMB, USD and HKD, of which approximately HK$295.1 million were current interest-bearing borrowings (31 December 2015: approximately HK$233.4 million) and HK$0.6 million were non-current interest- bearing borrowings (31 December 2015: approximately HK$69.9 million). Approximately 72.5% of the borrowings were fixed rate borrowings and 27.5% of the borrowings were variable rate borrowings. The Group’s gearing ratio, measured by net debt divided by shareholders’ equity as at the end of the periods and multiplied by 100%, increased from approximately 12% as at 31 December 2015 to approximately 24% as at 30 June 2016. The Group is exposed to currency risk primarily through sales and purchases made by the subsidiaries in the PRC which give rise to receivables, payables, cash balances and bank loans that are denominated in USD. At present, the Group has no hedging policy with respect to the foreign exchange exposure. As the functional currency for all subsidiaries in the PRC are RMB, these subsidiaries are not exposed to any currency risk due to the exchange rate movement of RMB. For subsidiaries established outside of the PRC, they have no material financial assets and liabilities denominated in RMB. Accordingly, the Group’s exposure to RMB currency risk is insignificant. During the six months ended 30 June 2016, the Group’s total capital expenditure amounted to approximately HK$131.5 million (30 June 2015: approximately HK$58.1 million), which was used in the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. As at 30 June 2016, the Group had pledged its lease prepayments, machinery and building held for own use with net book value of approximately HK$148.9 million (31 December 2015: approximately HK$163.0 million) for the purpose of securing loans with carrying value of approximately HK$39.4 million (31 December 2015: approximately HK$72.3 million).

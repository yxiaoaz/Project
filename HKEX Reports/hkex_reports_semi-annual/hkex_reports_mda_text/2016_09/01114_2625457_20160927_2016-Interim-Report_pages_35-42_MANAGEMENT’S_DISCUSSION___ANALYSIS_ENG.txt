minibuses, representing a decrease of 8.4% from 27,046 units sold during the first six months of 2015. The decrease in the sales volume of Haise during the first half of 2016 was primarily caused by intense price competition from other minibuses manufacturers in the similar market sector for lower end minibuses. On the other hand, sales volume of the Granse products increased by 75.3% from 3,005 units for the first half of 2015 to 5,267 units for the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was a result of price repositioning initiations undertaken by the Group during the period. In addition, Shenyang Automotive also sold 1,512 units of the new Huasong 7 MPV during the first six months of 2016, compared to 139 units during the period from its launch in March 2015 to June 2015. Unaudited cost of sales increased by 24.7% from RMB1,946.8 million in the first six months of 2015 to RMB2,427.0 million for the same period in 2016. The proportionally higher increase in cost of sales as compared to the increase in revenue during the first half of 2016 was mainly due to a higher amortisation of intangible assets in relation to Huasong recorded during the period. As a result, the unaudited gross profit margin of the Group dropped to 2.4% in the first half of 2016 from 5.4% in the same period in 2015. Unaudited other income increased by 2.8 times from RMB9.9 million in the first six months of 2015 to RMB37.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in government grants received during the period, as well as an increase in exchange gains from the translation of foreign currency denominated balances as a result of RMB depreciation. Unaudited interest income decreased by 42.3% from RMB42.7 million in the first six months of 2015 to RMB24.7 million for the same period in 2016 due to lower cash balances kept in fixed deposits and a decrease in interest rates during the period. Unaudited selling expenses increased by 28.2% from RMB203.7 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB261.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in selling expenses was driven mainly by an increase in advertising activities to promote the Huasong 7 MPV. Selling expense as a percentage of revenue increased from 9.9% to 10.5% between the two periods for the same reason. Unaudited general and administrative expenses decreased by 14.9% from RMB188.5 million in the first six months of 2015 to RMB160.5 million for the same period in 2016 due to the fact that certain startup costs related to the establishment of Brilliance-BEA Auto Finance Co., Ltd recorded in the six months period ended 30th June, 2015 have not recurred this year, and also as a result of administrative cost controls implemented during the same period in 2016. Unaudited finance costs decreased by 5.0% from RMB74.5 million for the first six months of 2015 to RMB70.8 million for the same period in 2016, as a result of a decrease in bank borrowings and bank borrowing interest rates. The Group’s unaudited share of results of joint ventures decreased by 6.9% from RMB2,047.3 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB1,905.9 million for the same period in 2016. This was primarily attributable to decreased profits contributed by BMW Brilliance, the Group’s 50% indirectly-owned joint venture. Unaudited net profit contributed to the Group by BMW Brilliance decreased by 6.9% from RMB2,050.0 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB1,908.0 million for the same period this year. The BMW joint venture achieved sales of 142,220 BMW vehicles in the first six months of 2016, an increase of 1.7% as compared to 139,775 BMW vehicles sold in the same period in 2015. The sales volumes of the locally produced 3-series, 5-series and X1 achieved in the first six months of 2016 were 49,580 units, 69,430 units and 17,698 units, respectively, compared to 48,009 units, 72,421 units and 19,345 units, respectively, for the same period in 2015. The new locally produced 2-series active tourer was launched in March 2016 and achieved sales volume of 5,512 units during the period. The drop in the net profit contributed by BMW Brilliance during the six months ended 30th June, 2016 was caused by the incurrence of upfront expenditures for production start-ups of new vehicles and capacity expansion measures, as well as higher selling and marketing expenses incurred during the first half of 2016. The Group’s unaudited share of results of associates increased by 35.8% from RMB109.6 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB148.8 million in the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily attributable to an increase in the contribution from Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. during the first six months of 2016 as a result of strong customer demand for certain engine models. The Group’s unaudited profit before income tax expense decreased by 9.3% from RMB1,854.4 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB1,682.8 million for the same period in 2016. Unaudited income tax expense has decreased by 72.6% from RMB19.3 million in the first half of 2015 to RMB5.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016, due to the booking of an income tax provision during the first six months of 2015. As a result of the above, the Group recorded an unaudited profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of RMB1,801.9 million for the first half of 2016, representing a decrease of 5.7% from the RMB1,910.5 million for the same period in 2015. Unaudited basic earnings per share for the six months ended 30th June, 2016 amounted to RMB0.35782 compared to RMB0.38014 for the same period in 2015. The Company declared a dividend of HK$0.11 per share (2015: same), amounting to a total of about HK$554.1 million for the year (2015: HK$552.8 million). Following the deceleration of China’s economic growth in 2015 and a difficult year for the auto industry, the Chinese auto market demonstrated tremendous resilience under this challenging environment during the first six months of 2016. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, during the six months period ended 30th June, 2016, a total of 12.8 million vehicles were sold in China, representing an increase of 8.1% over the same period last year. Of these, 11.0 million units were passenger vehicles, representing a growth rate of 9.2% over the same period last year. The premium passenger vehicle segment had once again outperformed the overall passenger vehicle market, delivering volume growth of around 13% during this period. Since the beginning of the year, our BMW Brilliance joint venture (“BBA” or the “JV”) had been busy preparing itself for its new production and product launches. The capacity expansion project at the Tiexi plant was completed at the start of the year with the addition of an all-new front-wheel-drive production platform. Together with the Dadong plant, the JV has now reached total annual production capacity of over 400,000 units providing for products of different architectures. In addition, the new engine plant in Tiexi had also commenced operation at the beginning of the year, enabling local production of the brand new 3 and 4-cylinder BMW engines in the JV. These new facilities will support the JV’s multiple new product launch cycle starting in 2016 with the new 2-series active tourer and the next generation X1 long-wheelbase which were introduced to the market in March and May of 2016, respectively. During the first half of 2016, BBA recorded sales of 142,220 units of BMW vehicles, representing an increase of 1.7% when compared to the same period last year. The 3-series continued to show growth while the 2-series active tourer contributed newly added volume, which had more than compensated for the drop in X1 and 5-series volumes during this period due mainly to life cycle reasons. With the new X1 now in the market, the JV expects X1 sales to pick up speed over the remaining of the year. The JV also has measures in place to upkeep the 5-series’ competitiveness for the remaining of the year. BBA has continued to expand its dealer network which had reached 435 full service 4S shops nationwide as at 30th June, 2016. The JV continues to work closely with its sales organization on all fronts in an effort to sustain the profitability of both the JV and its dealers. Our JV’s sales activities will continue to be supported by the BMW auto finance company which has continued to contribute to the profits of the JV so far. Despite a normalizing market, Brilliance continues to be confident about the long-term growth prospects of the Chinese premium auto industry, and believes the new products to be introduced by BBA over the next few years will broaden and also better tailor our product portfolio to the Chinese consumers’ preferences. Concurrently, the topics of cost reduction, streamlining of operation, sales volume enhancement, component localization, and further integration of our JV into the BMW network via potential exports of vehicles and components from China will all remain key focus areas for the JV’s ongoing operation. As for the minibus business, the new premium Huasong MPV model has entered the second year of its life cycle. Sales during the first six months of 2016 was unexciting, as further efforts are still required in promoting brand recognition and re-evaluating market opportunities. At the same time, the Group continues to produce facelift versions of its existing minibus and MPV models in order to make them more competitive. The Group is also considering potential strategic moves to turnaround its minibus operation over time. However, it is likely that the minibus and MPV operation will continue to create a negative impact to the Group’s overall financial performance for the whole year. The remaining months of 2016 will continue to be very challenging for the Group. Maintaining the prominent position of BMW Brilliance in the premium auto market remains the Group’s business priority. Apart from that, the Group also continues to look for new business opportunities as well as ways to further streamline its existing operation and corporate structure to support its business growth. As at 30th June, 2016, the Group had RMB1,753.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB1,070.9 million), RMB242.9 million in short-term bank deposits (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB676 million) and RMB1,619.1 million in pledged short-term bank deposits (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB1,325.5 million).

The remaining balance of 3.87% (as at 31st December, 2015: 2.38%) were denominated in other currencies. Apart from the borrowings, banking facilities have been put in place for contingency purposes. As at 30th June, 2016, the Group’s total available banking facilities for its daily operations amounted to RMB373.5 million (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB268.4 million) without any committed banking facilities. The Group funds its short-term working capital requirement mainly through its own operational cash flow, short-term bank borrowings, issue of bank guaranteed notes and payment credit from its suppliers. The Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents considered adequate by the management to finance the Group’s operations, expected expansion and product developments. The management also monitors the utilisation of bank borrowings and ensures compliance with loan covenants. For long-term capital expenditures, the Group’s strategy is to fund these long-term capital commitments by a combination of operational cash flow, bank borrowings, dividends from joint ventures and associates, and fund raising exercises in the capital market, if and when necessary. For the first six months of 2016, the Group incurred capital expenditure of RMB161.4 million (six months ended 30th June, 2015: RMB222.3 million) mainly for the acquisition of tools and moulds, machinery and equipment, and development costs for minibuses. As at 30th June, 2016, the Group’s capital commitments, including those authorised but not yet contracted for, amounted to RMB555.6 million (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB321.6 million). Among such capital commitments, contracted capital commitments amounted to RMB441.3 million (as at 31st December, 2015: RMB261.8 million), which was primarily capital expenditure in respect of construction projects and acquisition of plant and machinery. To meet the changing customer demands and to strengthen our market position in the PRC, Shenyang Automotive will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the development of new MPV models, upgrading of existing products and expansion of its product portfolio. Significant Investments Held, Material Acquisitions and Disposals of Subsidiaries, Associates and There were no significant investments held, nor were there any material acquisitions or disposals of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures during the six months ended 30th June, 2016.

Apart from those disclosed herein, there was no plan authorised by the Board for other material investments or additions of capital assets as at the date of this report. As at 30th June, 2016, the gearing ratio, computed by dividing total liabilities by total equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, was approximately 0.38 (as at 31st December, 2015: 0.40). The decrease in the gearing ratio was primarily due to higher comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Company generated during the period. Despite a decrease in the overseas sales of the Group, the Group considers that exchange rate fluctuations may have some effect on the overall financial performance of the Group but it is still at a manageable level. The Group will continue to monitor the situation and may consider entering into hedging arrangements in order to minimise foreign exchange risks, if and when necessary. There were no outstanding hedging transactions as at 30th June, 2016 (as at 30th June, 2015: nil).

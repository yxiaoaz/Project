The Group is an established and leading manufacturer in the PRC engaged in the research and development, production and sale of a variety of FRP products. The Group’s major products consist of: (i) FRP grating products; (ii) USCG approved phenolic grating products; (iii) FRP subway evacuation platform products; (iv) epoxy wedge strip products; and (v) FRP crosstie products. The applications for FRP are quite wide including building and construction field, electrical and telecommunications engineering. As the product is characterised by its light weight, high strength, toughness, anti-slippery, anti-erosion, flame retardant, insulation and easy to colour and artistic properties as well as its good and comprehensive economic benefits, it is widely applied in industries including petrochemical, electrical, marine engineering, plating, vessel, metallurgy, steel, papermaking, brewing and municipal industry and mainly used in operating platform, equipment platform, stair treads, trench covers, filter plates, etc, which indicates that it is an ideal component for corrosive environment. Given that FRP delivers outstanding performance as a comparatively new type of materials and as a substitute of traditional materials such as wood, concrete and metal, and the potential application of products made of FRP composites in a wide range of fields such as aerospace, energy and transportation industries, the management expects that the overall FRP market in China will grow at a CAGR of 8.0% for the next three years in the light of gradual maturity and better understanding of the FRP market in future. Since August 2017, the Group has commenced the production of a new product category, FRP crossties, which was successfully launched in the market during the financial year ended 31 December 2017. It is encouraging to see that FRP crossties generated approximately RMB1.2 million of revenue to the Group which accounted for approximately 3.7% of the Group’s total sales for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The gross margin generated from this product category was approximately 22.5% over the same period. FRP crossties is expected to maintain considerable growth in market demand and becomes a significant revenue driver to the Group in future. Looking ahead, despite a slight slowdown of China’s macro-economic conditions and the trade war between the PRC and the United States of America (“US”), the continuous rigid growth in capital investment in infrastructure and projects by countries along the “Belt and Road Initiative”, in particular the investment in transport infrastructure in central and eastern Europe, would potentially contribute to a sustained growth in the FRP market in the PRC and other peripheral countries. However, the growth in future will be at a slower pace. The management expects that the market would maintain a healthy CAGR of 8.0% for the next three years (i.e. from 2018 to 2020). In future years, the Group will participate proactively in tender bidding for all potential projects with open arms so as to exercise more effective cost control and strengthen the competitiveness of the Group. Meanwhile, the Group will recruit more talents to fulfil its development needs to support and expand its business. The Group posted a consolidated revenue of approximately RMB32.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018, representing a healthy increase of approximately RMB1.4 million or 4.5% as compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the increase in sales revenue generated from sales of FRP grating products and FRP subway evacuation platform products, and the launch of FRP crosstie products in 2017, which was partially offset by the decrease in sales of epoxy wedge strip products and USCG approved phenolic grating products. Moreover, sales of overseas markets increased significantly by approximately 53.0% to approximately RMB17.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 from approximately RMB11.5 million for the same period in 2017. The overseas markets contributed 53.9% of total sales for the six months ended 30 June 2018, which has increased by approximately 17.1% in comparison with that of approximately 36.8% for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Details of the Group’s revenue and gross profit margin by product categories are as follows: ended 30 June 2018 For the six months ended 30 June 2017 USCG approved phenolic FRP subway evacuation During the six months ended 30 June 2018, sales of FRP grating products remained the largest contributor to the Group’s revenue and it accounted for approximately 73.0% of the total revenue of the Group. The percentage of contribution has increased from 64.1% for the six months ended 30 June 2017. FRP grating products were mainly sold to corporate customers in the PRC who generally are end-users of such products, as well as distributors in the US and the United Kingdom (“UK”) who generally buy the products on per purchase order basis with no distribution arrangement. Revenue derived from sales of FRP grating products increased by approximately 19.0% from approximately RMB19.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB23.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This is mainly attributable to the increase in sales in the overseas markets, in particular the US market. The gross profit margin decreased by approximately 3.8% from approximately 33.6% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately 29.8% for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This was primarily to: (i) devaluation to US dollars against RMB; and (ii) increase in cost of production due to salary increment and increase in costs of raw materials. USCG approved phenolic grating products were generally sold to shipbuilders and offshore oilfields construction companies in the PRC. Revenue generated from sales of USCG approved phenolic grating products decreased significantly by approximately 66.3% from approximately RMB4.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB1.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The sharp reduction was due to the downturn in the shipbuilding industry in China and nearby surrounding countries, which caused the customers to be more conservative on placing new orders. There were some cases where orders were deferred to the second half year of 2018. The gross profit margin increased by approximately 4.6% from approximately 39.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately 43.8% for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This was mainly due to the increased level of complexity in the cutting technique which allowed for an increase in the average selling price of this product category with no noticeable increase in cost of production. FRP subway evacuation platform products were sold to main contractors who principally engaged in railway construction works in the PRC. Revenue generated from sales of FRP subway evacuation platform products increased by approximately 11.6% from approximately RMB1.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB1.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The increase in sales was due to the fact that a major project was only introduced in the first half year of 2017 and as such a lower sales revenue was recognized in the six months ended 30 June 2017 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2018. The gross profit margin reduced by approximately 13.6% from approximately 29.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately 15.4% for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Due to the orders received to supplement the previous finished orders, the production line, which was temporarily halted, was not running efficiently on resumption of production. This caused a relatively lower gross profit margin in comparison with that achieved in the corresponding six months in 2017. Epoxy wedge strip products were developed and targeted for manufacturers of wind turbine blades in the PRC. The revenue derived from sales of epoxy wedge strip products decreased by approximately RMB584,000 or 12.6% from approximately RMB4.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB4.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This was largely attributable to the fact that the imposition of several controlling measurements by the government in the wind turbine manufacturing industry has led to hesitation of the customers in placing new orders. The gross profit margin reduced by approximately 9.6% from approximately 43.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately 33.4% for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The reduction in gross profit margin can be explained by the differences in product specifications in relation to different shapes, weight and dimensions for the products sold in the two periods. FRP crosstie products were developed in line with the PRC’s policies in promoting “Belt and Road Initiatives”. It is intended to apply as the replacement of wooden crossties for the railway sector. The target customers of such products are (i) the PRC railway corporations; and (ii) corporations which participate in the construction of national railway bridges. The FRP crosstie products were rolled out for commercial production in August 2017. The Group recorded sales revenue of approximately RMB1.2 million for FRP crosstie products for the six months ended 30 June 2018, which has contributed approximately 3.7% of revenue to the total sales and a gross profit margin of approximately 22.5% in the same period. Details of the average selling price and the sales volume by product categories are as follows: ended 30 June 2018 ended 30 June 2017 selling selling 88,580 m2 73,243 m2 USCG approved phenolic 2,657 m2 8,325 m2 FRP subway evacuation 5,468 m2 4,900 m2 67 m3 The average selling price of the FRP grating products per m2 slightly decreased by approximately 1.7% from RMB272.2 per m2 for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to RMB267.7 per m2 for the six months ended 30 June 2018, with an increase in sales volume of approximately 20.9% in comparison between the two periods. The decrease in average selling price was mainly due to the devaluation of US dollars against RMB whereas the increase in sales volume was due to the increase in sales for overseas markets. The average selling price of the USCG approved phenolic grating products per m2 increased by approximately 5.7% from RMB578.2 per m2 for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to RMB611.2 per m2 for the six months ended 30 June 2018, with a decrease in sales volume of approximately 68.1% in comparison between the two periods. The increase in average selling price was mainly due to the increased level of complexity in the cutting technique which caused an increase in the average selling price of this product category. The average selling price of the FRP subway evacuation platform products per m2 remained unchanged, with an increase in sales volume of approximately 11.6% in comparison between the two periods. The average selling price of the epoxy wedge strip products per metre decreased by approximately 6.4% from RMB48.7 per metre for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to RMB45.6 per metre for the six months ended 30 June 2018, with a decrease in sales volume of approximately 6.7% in comparison between the two periods. The decrease in average selling price was mainly due to the substantial increase in sale of product items with different shapes, weight and dimensions which procured lower average selling price. The average selling price of the FRP crosstie products was RMB17,777.8 per m3 for the six months ended 30 June 2018, and the sales volume was 67 m3 in the same period. This product category was launched in the market in August 2017. Details of the Group’s sale revenue by geographical area are as follows: Sales to the PRC market significantly decreased by approximately 23.8% from approximately RMB19.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB15.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This is because of the allocation of production capacity to more urgent orders from overseas and the reduction in sales of the USCG approved phenolic grating products during the six months period ended 30 June 2018. Sales to the US market increased significantly by approximately 87.8% from approximately RMB4.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB9.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018, mainly because of the increase on sales order from the major customers and acquisition of some new customers in the US market. Sales to the UK market also increased by approximately 28.2% from approximately RMB5.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB6.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018, mainly because of the increase on sales order from the major customers and acquisition of new customers in the UK market. Sales to the other locations increased by approximately 23.5% from approximately RMB1.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to approximately RMB1.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018, mainly because of new customers acquired in Lithuania and Korea. The selling and distribution costs of the Group increased by approximately RMB862,000, or 26.7% to approximately RMB4.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 from approximately RMB3.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to the uplift of advertising expenses and transportation costs resulting from the surge of overseas sales during the six months ended 30 June 2018. The administrative expenses decreased by approximately RMB849,000, or 12.4% to approximately RMB6.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 from approximately RMB6.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. This is primarily due to the conscientious effort taken by the management in controlling the administrative expenses of the Group. Finance costs increased by approximately RMB82,000 to approximately RMB607,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2018 from approximately RMB525,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2017, which was mainly due to the general increase in bank rates during the six months ended 30 June 2018. Loss for the six months ended 30 June 2018 increased to approximately RMB826,000 from that of approximately RMB471,000 for the corresponding six months in 2017. This is mainly attributable to the reduction in the gross profit margin of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2018. As at 30 June 2018, the Group held total assets of approximately RMB86.4 million (31 December 2017: approximately RMB90.6 million), including cash and cash equivalents of approximately RMB10.1 million (31 December 2017: approximately RMB11.3 million). As at 30 June 2018, the Group had total liabilities of approximately RMB39.6 million (31 December 2017: approximately RMB43.2 million) which mainly comprise of bank borrowings amounting to approximately RMB20 million (31 December 2017: approximately RMB20 million). As at 30 June 2018, the gearing ratio, expressed as a percentage of net debt (bank borrowing less cash and cash equivalents) over total capital employed (net debt plus total equity attributable to owners of the Company) was about 17.5% (31 December 2017: 15.5%). The increase in gearing ratio was mainly attributable to the increase in net debt during the six months ended 30 June 2018. As at 30 June 2018, the share capital and total equity attributable to equity holders of the Company amounted to approximately RMB3,600,000 (31 December 2017: RMB3,600,000) and RMB46,771,000 (31 December 2017: RMB47,397,000) respectively. The Group reported net cash flows of approximately RMB1.5 million generated from operations for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (six months ended 30 June 2017: approximately RMB7.9 million used in operations). The change in net cash flows in comparison between the two periods was mainly attributable to the settlement of account payables in the six months ended 30 June 2017 from the proceeds of placing of the Company’s shares in January 2017. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately RMB2.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (six months ended 30 June 2017: approximately RMB362,000). The significant increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the payments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Due to the placing of the Company’s shares in January 2017, net cash inflows from financing activities changed from approximately RMB21.3 million for the six months end 30 June 2017 to net cash outflows of approximately RMB610,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2018. As at 30 June 2018, the Group had no contingent liabilities (31 December 2017: Nil). The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily through sales which give rise to receivables and cash balances that are denominated in US dollars, which is attributable to sales transactions entered into by the Group with overseas customers. The Group has adopted the following measures to mitigate the exposure to foreign exchange risk: (i) the accounting and finance department would closely monitor the movement of relevant exchange rates to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level; (ii) quotations provided to our overseas customers are generally valid for one to three months only; (iii) in the event that the relevant exchange rates fluctuate more than 5.0%, the Director and senior management would be notified such that appropriate actions could be carried out in a timely manner to address any foreign exchange risks; (iv) if the fluctuation in the relevant exchange rates exceeds 8.0% for more than two months, the pricing policy would be adjusted accordingly to reflect such (v) the Directors would regularly review the analysis prepared by the accounting and finance department and assess whether there is any material and adverse impact on the Group’s financial performance and whether any hedging or derivative financial instruments should be entered into for managing the foreign exchange risk exposures. In addition to the above, the Group is generally able to pass the cost arising from exchange rate fluctuations on to the customers by adjusting the pricing. Hence, it is considered that the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited and it is not necessary to adopt any hedging strategy. As at 30 June 2018, the Group had the following charges on its assets: (i) the leasehold land held for own use under operating lease with a carrying value of RMB1,456,000 as at 30 June 2018 (31 December 2017: RMB1,474,000) and the building with a carrying value of RMB8,383,000 as at 30 June 2018 (31 December 2017: RMB8,700,000) were pledged for a bank borrowing in the amount of RMB20,000,000; (ii) an aggregate amount of RMB516,000 (31 December 2017: RMB1,059,000) was placed in a bank account and pledged in favour of banks for bill issuance and customers in relation to some sales transactions. (iii) bills receivables of RMB4,350,000 (31 December 2017: RMB3,400,000) were pledged to a bank in the PRC as securities for the issuance of bills by the Group. There was no material acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures by the Group during the six months ended 30 June 2018. As at 30 June 2018, the Group had 139 employees (31 December 2017: 135). The total staff costs including directors’ remuneration for the six months ended 30 June 2018 were approximately RMB6.8 million (six months ended 30 June 2017: approximately RMB5.7 million). Remuneration is determined based on each employee’s qualifications, position and seniority. In addition to a basic salary, year-end discretionary bonuses were offered with reference to our Group’s performance as well as individual’s performance to attract and retain appropriate and suitable personnel to serve the Group. Furthermore, the Group offers other staff benefits like provision of retirement benefits, various types of trainings and sponsorship of training courses. The Group also adopts an annual review system to assess the performance of staff, which forms the basis of decisions with respect to salary rises and promotions.

The Group is principally engaged in coke processing, international air and sea freight forwarding and the provision of logistics services as well as trading of securities. In order to develop its core business and target to be the leader of the newly growing mineral resources, the Board reduced the scale in the business activities of freight forwarding by transfer out the equity interest in the associated company, Shanghai International Airlines Services Co. Limited last year. It will also help to concentrate the Group’s resources on the future development of its core principal activities coal mining and coke processing as well as other mineral resources in PRC. The Group had decided to re-locate more resources to occupy our unique market position in China especially in the Major energy Provinces, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. On 27th November 2008, the Company entered into a Disposal Agreement with Profit Firm whereby the Company was agreed to sell the entire interest in Funeway at a consideration of HK$15 Million. On 15th July 2009, the Disposal was unanimously passed by the Shareholders in the Special General Meeting. The disposal as part of restructure had successfully divest Shanxi Changxing, which was debt-burdened and heavy loss-making. In respect of the Group’s original plan to acquire 60% of equity interest of ChongHou Energy Resources Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Asset Rich Group, and to become the controlling shareholder thereof, this was abandoned due to Asset Rich’s failure to satisfy the Company’s due diligence review on or before the agreed long- stop date. The agreement with Asset Rich was terminated by way of a cancellation agreement, and the deposit paid by the Company for the acquisition has been returned in full by Asset Rich. The financial position of the Group then became healthier and stronger for our future merger and acquisitions. The Board of Directors has resolved not to recommend the payment of any interim dividend for the six months ended 30th June, 2009 (six months ended 30th June, 2008: Nil).

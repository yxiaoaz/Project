For the period under review, the Group’s revenue increased significantly by 105% to HK$1,126,865,000 (30 June 2017: HK$549,617,000) that was largely due to the increase in sales of the trading operation as well as the increase in interest income generated by the money lending business and from securities investments. The Group generally acquires securities listed on the Stock Exchange or other recognised stock exchanges and over-the-counter markets with good liquidity that can facilitate swift execution of securities transactions, and sometimes directly from target companies. For making investment or divestment decision on securities of individual target company, references will usually be made to the latest financial information, news and announcements issued by the target company, investment analysis reports that the Company has access to, as well as industry or macro-economic news. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held for long-term purpose, particular emphasis will be placed on the past financial performance of the target company including its sales and profit growth, financial healthiness, dividend policy, business prospect, industry and macroeconomic outlook. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held other than for long-term purpose, in addition to the factors mentioned, references will also be made to prevailing market sentiments on different sectors of the investment markets. In terms of return, for long-term securities investments, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of capital appreciation and dividend/ interest income. For securities investments other than for long-term holding, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of trading gains. At 30 June 2018, the Group’s investment in securities operation held (i) a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) portfolio (constituted by non-current and current portions), comprising equity securities listed in Hong Kong and unlisted convertible securities, valued at HK$2,040,224,000 (31 December 2017: HK$1,314,561,000, including equity securities of HK$44,259,000 previously recognised as available-for-sale (“AFS”) investments); and (ii) a debt instrument at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) portfolio, comprising listed debt securities in Hong Kong or overseas, valued at HK$1,089,586,000 (31 December 2017: HK$1,279,121,000, representing debt instruments previously recognised as AFS investments). As a whole, the operation recorded a revenue of HK$57,700,000 (30 June 2017: HK$33,296,000) and a profit of HK$461,400,000 (30 June 2017: loss of HK$105,014,000). At 30 June 2018, the Group held a financial asset at FVTPL portfolio amounting to HK$2,040,224,000 measured at market/fair value. During the review period, the portfolio generated a revenue of HK$7,656,000 (30 June 2017: HK$8,355,000, including dividend income of HK$1,817,000 previously recognised as dividend income from AFS investments) representing dividends from equity securities of HK$5,696,000 (30 June 2017: HK$5,879,000, including dividend income of HK$1,817,000 previously recognised as dividend income from AFS investments) and interest income from convertible and debt securities of HK$1,960,000 (30 June 2017: HK$2,476,000).

The net gain on financial assets at FVTPL was mainly due to the net increase in fair value of the Group’s listed equity securities portfolio and the net realised gain on disposal of listed equity securities during the current period. Such net increase in fair value of the Group’s listed equity securities portfolio was mainly contributed by the increase in fair value of the Group’s investment in listed shares of Evergrande Health Industry Group Limited, in which the Group has started to invest since March 2015, amounting to HK$528,776,000 during the current interim period.

The increases in revenue and profit of the operation were principally due to the increase in volume of metal minerals and coke products transacted during the current period, which was in turn resulting from the improvement of sentiments and positive outlook of commodity markets in general, as well as the management’s successful efforts in expanding the business scope of the operation. The Group’s money lending business is conducted through CS Credit Limited and U Credit (HK) Limited, both are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.

Such increases were mainly due to the higher average amount of loans advanced to borrowers during the current period and the management’s effort in enlarging the operation’s clientele base. During the period under review, there was no default in repayments from borrowers, nevertheless, an impairment allowance of HK$13,500,000 (including the impairment allowance of HK$11,800,000 recognised and restated at 1 January 2018 as detailed in Note 2.2.2), as a general provision, was recognised against loan receivables.

The increase in revenue recorded by the operation is largely due to the management’s effort in promoting its business and expanded its business scope to participation of corporate share placing and underwriting exercises, whilst the decline in its profit was mainly a result of additional headcounts and increase in certain administrative expenses of the operation. For the six months ended 30 June 2018, the Group recorded profit attributable to owners of the Company of HK$437,199,000 (30 June 2017: loss attributable to owners of the Company of HK$113,520,000) and basic earnings per share of HK2.57 cents (30 June 2017: loss per share of HK0.67 cent).

The increase in the Group’s gearing ratio was mainly due to the new margin financing raised for acquiring equity securities. The increase in the Group’s finance costs to HK$74,277,000 (30 June 2017: HK$65,499,000) was primarily a result of the new borrowings raised during the period.

The monetary assets and liabilities as well as business transactions of the Group are mainly denominated in Hong Kong dollars and United States dollars.

There have been indications showing recovery in business confidence and investor sentiments in major economies, including China and the United States, and increase in international trade flows including commodities, since the second half of 2017. The market uncertainties linked with the geopolitical risks in Korean peninsula, the pace of interest rate increase in the United States, and the instabilities in the European economy arising from the Brexit negotiations have also been reduced. However, the trade wars between the United States and China and with other countries/ economic group in recent months have added new uncertainties and variables to outlook of world economy and global financial markets.

The Group’s money lending business has continued to deliver very encouraging results for the current period.

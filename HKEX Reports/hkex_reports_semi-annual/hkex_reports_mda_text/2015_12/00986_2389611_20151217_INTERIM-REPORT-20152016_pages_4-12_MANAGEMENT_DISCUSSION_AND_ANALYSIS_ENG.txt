The Group recorded a turnover of approximately HK$31.28 million, representing an increase of approximately 107.88% as compared with the turnover of approximately HK$15.05 million of the corresponding period of 2014. The increase in turnover was mainly attributable to the contribution from the newly acquired businesses of internet sales and services as well as the trading of petrochemical products. The Group’s unaudited net loss for the period under review was approximately HK$108.18 million (2014: approximately HK$32.18 million). The increase in unaudited net loss was mainly due to (i) impairment loss on available-for-sale investment in respect of the Company’s investment in Pure Power Holdings Limited (“Pure Power”) of approximately HK$68.97 million (2014: Nil); and (ii) goodwill impairment loss of approximately HK$19.20 million recognized for the six months ended 30 September 2015 (2014: Nil). However, the Group recorded an unrealized gain of approximately HK$680.81 million on investments in equity securities listed in Hong Kong at fair value through other comprehensive income in profit or loss for the six months ended 30 September 2015. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses were approximately HK$16.08 million (2014: approximately HK$14.38 million), representing an increase of approximately 11.86% as compared with the same period last year. The finance costs of the Group amounted to approximately HK$5.39 million (2014: approximately HK$19.69 million) which were mainly incurred on the unconvertible bonds and the promissory notes issued by the Company. The decrease in finance costs was due to reduction in debt level during the period under review. The Group is principally engaged in the businesses of waste paper, scrap metal and consumable wastes recycling, trading of petrochemical products and online products sales, provision of web design and maintenance services and marketing services. For the six months ended 30 September 2015, the revenues from the wastes recycling business and trading of petrochemical products business were approximately HK$16.40 million (2014: approximately HK$15.05 million) and HK$7.99 million (2014: Nil) respectively. The revenue contributed by the newly acquired business of internet sales and services for the six months ended 30 September 2015 was approximately HK$6.88 million (2014: Nil). As disclosed in the annual report of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2015, the continuous rise in the costs of raw materials, labor and manufacturing overheads had a serious impact on the Group’s recycling paper business performance. The situation did not improve during the period under review and it seems unable to recover in the near future. As the financial performance of recycling paper business for the six months ended 30 September 2015 deteriorated and the demand for recycled paper might not be as robust as expected, the valuation assumptions and the cash flow projection have been further adjusted to reflect a more conservative expectation of the Company. As a consequence, the Group recognised an impairment loss on goodwill of approximately HK$15.50 million for the recycling paper business for the six months ended 30 September 2015. The disposal of electric car battery business of the Group was completed on 30 September 2015, and the Company received the total consideration of HK$66.00 million together with the accrued interest of approximately HK$0.83 million. In order to diversify the business of the Group for maximizing returns to the shareholders of the Company, the Group has been actively seeking various investment opportunities, and entered into the following transactions: A. On 16 October 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company has acquired the entire share capital of a company holding a money lender’s license under Money Lenders Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong). The Board considers that such acquisition provides a prime opportunity for the Group to enter the money lending industry, which is a new business segment to the Group. The Board also considers that the demand for money lending is significant and the industry is vibrant in Hong Kong. The entry into the industry provides an attractive opportunity for the Group to broaden its income base. B. The Company has acquired 850 shares of US$1.0 each in the issued share capital of Pure Power (representing 10% of its issued share capital) which in turn owned 100% equity interest in a company (the “Oil Company”) principally engaged in the exploration and exploitation of natural resources in Nevada, the United States of America in 2014. According to a geological and drilling report produced by Ehni Enterprises Inc., a company specialised in geological consulting, in September 2015 on one of the wells owned and operated by the Oil Company, the results from the drilling showed presence of oil/condensate and gas anomalies and significant intervals of sandstone units bearing oil/hydrocarbon which were observed down the well. On 13 November 2015, the Company (as the purchaser) entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Previous SPA”) with certain shareholders of Pure Power (the “Previous Vendors”) regarding the proposed acquisition of 4,112 shares of US$1.0 each in the issued share capital of Pure Power at the consideration of HK$200 million, representing approximately 48.38% of the issued share capital of Pure Power. On 20 November 2015, the directors of the Company (the “Directors”) re- considered to acquire Pure Power in a combined consideration of cash and promissory notes, which is expected to be the most advantageous way to control the financial exposure of the Company. The Company has re-negotiated with the Previous Vendors to reduce the percentage of equity interest acquired in Pure Power. Accordingly, the Company has entered into a deed with the Previous Vendors to terminate the Previous SPA. After termination of the Previous SPA, the Company has entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with part of the Previous Vendors (the “Vendors”), pursuant to which the Company has conditionally agreed to acquire and the Vendors have conditionally agreed to dispose of 3,350 shares, representing approximately 39.41% of the issued share capital of Pure Power, at the consideration of HK$163 million, which shall be settled as to HK$100 million by way of delivery of the promissory notes issued by the Company due 12 months from the issue and carrying interest of 8% per annum and as to HK$63 million by cash. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company will be indirectly interested in aggregate approximately 49.41% of the issued share capital of the Oil Company through Pure Power, and Pure Power will be an associate of the Company. The Directors consider that the acquisition will increase the Company’s interest in the Oil Company which are showing good prospects on exploration and development, and create room for business development given the presence of oil/condensate and gas anomalies and significant intervals of sandstone units bearing oil/hydrocarbon from the well owned and operated by the Oil Company. It is also a good opportunity for the Group to achieve good investment returns in the energy sector with an aim to enhance the Group’s future financial performance and profitability, and thereby improve the return of the shareholders of the Company. C. On 16 November 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary (as the purchaser) of the Company entered into a sale and purchase agreement with an independent third party in relation to an acquisition of a company licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on the regulated activities of dealing in securities, advising on securities and providing asset management. By investing in the aforesaid company, it is expected that the Group can enter into financial services industry, being a new business segment to the Group, and will be benefited from diversifying its revenue stream which is expected to increase its shareholders’ value and benefit the Company and its shareholders as a whole. Details of which are set out in the announcement of the Company dated 16 November 2015. Going forward, the Group will continue looking for other investment opportunities in other streams so as to sustain the growth of the Group in the long run. Outlook (Continued) B.

The Group has recorded a gain on change in fair value of the listed equity securities for the period under review of approximately HK$680.81 million (2014: Nil). However, the future value of the listed equities may be volatile to external market condition. The Group will continue to adopt a diversified investment strategy including investing in quality stocks and other financial products with a view to achieve better shareholders’ return. On 4 September 2015, the Company and Mr. Wong Him Shun Philip as a vendor entered into a sale and purchase agreement, pursuant to which the vendor has conditionally agreed to sell and the Company has conditionally agreed to acquire the entire equity interest in Elite Honest Inc. (“Elite Honest”), at a consideration of HK$30 million by way of issue of promissory note by the Company.

During the six months ended 30 September 2015, the Group did not enter into any derivative contracts aimed at minimizing exchange rate risks, but the Group will continue to review its foreign exchange exposure regularly and might consider using financial instruments to hedge against foreign exchange exposure at appropriate times. The Company announced that a writ of summons (the “Writ”) was issued in the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong by First Federal Capital Limited (“FDCL”) against the Company and it was served on the Company by FDCL’s legal adviser on 8 July 2013.

The Promissory Note was issued by the Company to All Prosper Group Limited (the “Note Holder”) and was due on 31 January 2013. The Company has been in negotiation with the Note Holder for extension of the maturity date for the Promissory Note but as there has been dispute between the Note Holder with FDCL on the ownership of the Promissory Note, the negotiation for extension is pending. FDCL has through its legal adviser requested the Company to register a transfer of the Promissory Note from the Note Holder to FDCL but has not delivered all necessary documents as requested by the Company and as required under the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The Company considered that the registration of the transfer of the Promissory Note shall only be made upon strict compliance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note for the interest of the Company. The Company has made enquiry to the Note Holder on the transfer of the Promissory Note to FDCL and was informed that the Note Holder has all along been the registered holder of the Promissory Note and has not effected any transfer of the Promissory Note.

Within the BRIC economies, the growth of Indian demand has been a key contributor to growth. Demand for aluminium in North America improved by 5.6% YoY. Statistics from the Aluminum Association indicate that the year-to-date new mill orders index increased by 5.8% in 1H 2015, whereas shipments of aluminium extruded products by U.S. and Canadian producers increased by 9.0%. The June 2015 Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (“SAAR”) for light-vehicle sales in the U.S. increased to 17.1 million, the highest level since 2005. In June 2015, year-to-date light-vehicle sales amounted to 8.5 million, a 4.4% increase compared to the same period of last year. Total vehicle production increased by 2.6% YoY to 9 million in 1H 2015. In June 2015, new-home construction in the U.S. climbed to the second-highest level since November 2007 as housing starts rose by 9.3% to an annualized rate of 1.17 million units from a revised 1.07 million units in May. Building permits in June were up by 7.4% to a 1.34 million-unit annualized rate, the highest since July 2007. In 1H 2015, aluminium demand in Europe grew by 2.3% YoY. Turkey, Italy, France and Germany represent the key growth markets, respectively increasing consumption by 6.1%, 2.6%, 2.4% and There has been particularly strong aluminium demand in the automotive sector. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reported that car sales increased by 6.8% over the first five months of 2015. The annual forecast estimates 5% growth. Passenger car production in Germany in 1H 2015 was stable compared to 2014. Automotive production in Turkey grew by 18% in the first five months of 2015. The European construction market has shown signs of recovery. Despite the growth rate slowing by half compared to March, Eurozone construction output increased for the second consecutive month in April. Production in construction remained stable in the euro area and grew by 1.3% YoY in the EU28 in April Excluding China, primary aluminium consumption in Asia increased by 1.3% in 1H 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. On the negative side, Japan’s industrial output decreased in May by 4% YoY as a slowdown in the production of transport equipment and cars weakened the recovery. Passenger cars, followed by automobile parts, were the largest contributors to the decline in production. The first five months of 2015 saw a 9% YoY drop in Japanese automotive production contributing to a 2.1% YoY slump in total Japanese aluminium semis production in January-May. At the same time, Japan’s July Flash Manufacturing PMI rose for the third consecutive month to 51.4 from 50.1 in June, the highest index since February 2015, supporting a more positive outlook for 2H 2015. Industrial production in the Republic of Korea decreased by 2.8% YoY and 1.3% month-on-month (MoM) in May. Automotive production in South Korea fell by 3.3% YoY in January-May 2015. Consequently, South Korea’s primary aluminium consumption growth slowed to 2.4% in 1H 2015. China’s primary aluminium apparent consumption was 14.6 million tonnes in 1H 2015, up by 10.4% YoY. Q2 GDP growth on a yearly basis was better than expected, reaching 7%. Industrial production growth accelerated to 6.8% YoY from 6.1%. At the same time, the PMI for production activity in China in July was 47.8 points, down from 49.4 points in the previous month and far below expectations, pointing to weaker 2H 2015 economic growth. This means aluminium consumption growth might slow in 2H 2015. In the housing sector, surveys show that prices are now stabilising (on a month-on-month basis). The overall floor space of housing projects under construction for all real estate enterprises was 6.169 billion square meters in January-May 2015, up 5.3% YoY. Nonetheless, the Chinese property market is showing signs of entering a downturn. In January- May 2015, the floor space of marketable homes sold totaled 359.96 million square meters, down 0.2% YoY, compared to a decrease of 4.8% for the first four months of 2015. In January-May 2015, land purchased by real estate enterprises stood at 76.50 million square meters, down 31.0 % YoY, compared to a decline of 32.7% for the first four months of 2015. Automobile production and sales totaled 10.244 million units and 10.046 million units, respectively, in January-May 2015, up by 3.18% and 2.11% YoY, CAAM reported. UC RUSAL has reduced its initial global aluminium demand growth forecast from 6.5% to 6%, or 58 million tonnes for the whole of 2015, due to weaker demand in various emerging markets and declines in both Japan and South Korea. IAI and CRU data shows that aluminium production ex-China grew by 2.0% YoY in 1H 2015 to12.992 million tonnes. This growth was mainly from Asia and the Middle East, with South and North America leading the decline in production. Since January 2015, net ex-China production has risen by 251,000 tonnes. The aluminium all-in price has declined by 22% since the beginning of 2015, to USD1772 per tonne, making around 5 million tonnes of production outside of China unprofitable. At current prices, we assume around 16% or 5 millon tonnes of ex-China production is unprofitable and at risk of closure. UC RUSAL has already officially announced the potential closure of up to 200,000 tonnes of production this year. Overcapacity in the Chinese aluminium market continued throughout 1Q 2015, with record supply growth of 7.45 million tonnes, up by 8.3% YoY. As a result, total aluminium stocks in China grew to 3.0 million tonnes in 1Q 2015, up by 1.0% YoY. The aluminium balance in China improved during the second quarter of 2015, and as a result total stocks fell by 353,000 tonnes to 2.65 million tonnes by the end of 2Q 2015. It is expected, that the aluminium balance in China will continue to improve in 3Q 2015. From January to May 2015, Chinese installed aluminium capacity rose by 1.0 million tonnes per year to 36.545 million tonnes. Around 1.5 million tpy of operating capacity was commissioned and around 510,000 tpy was resumed for the same period. This created additional supply pressures in domestic markets, which resulted in a 2.6% decrease in the SHFE price during 1H 2015. The decline in price continued through July 2015, and as a result about 39% of Chinese aluminium production capacity, or 12.3 million tonnes, were loss-making at an average SHFE price in July 1-20 of RMB12,380 per tonne. The main change to the supply environment resulted from the export of aluminium semis from China. Net exports of semis rose by 47% YoY in 1H 2015. Due to a seasonal slowdown in the domestic market, aluminium product manufacturers had to export, even at a loss, in order to generate cash flow. The products include heavy gauge extrusions, plate and cast coil, which are made with minimum semi-fabrication transformation. The products are either remelted or stockpiled and used as collateral in financial transactions. UC RUSAL is skeptical that Chinese aluminium producers will be able to increase semis exports in 2H 2015, as these exports are already unprofitable. This may result in a potential slowdown in Chinese exports in the second half of the year. As a result of both rising Chinese semi exports and growth of ex-China aluminium production, UC RUSAL estimates that the global aluminium market faces a minor surplus of 277,000 tonnes in FY15. Premiums have collapsed across all regions in 1H 2015 as contango disappeared and metal from warehouses flooded the market. Premiums began falling in Europe, where the highest concentration of off-warrants stock is present. This was followed by North America, where an oversupply was created by attracting metal with the highest rates of return. Asia also witnessed a collapse in premiums as a result of increasing exports of Chinese semis. In relation to premiums, the current levels of contango have supported the attractiveness of metal financing. Currently 3m contango stands at USD42 per tonne. As a result, premiums stabilised at the end of 2Q 2015. It is expected that metal holders will look to gain contango and lock the metal for 3-9 months into financial deals in order to support premiums. Nevertheless, entrance into long-term deals is unlikely as a result of the uncertainty regarding further warehousing reforms and regulations. Since the beginning of 2015, LME stocks have dropped by 631,000 tonnes to 3.574 million tonnes, or by 1.272 million tonnes annualized. The principal activities of the Group are alumina refining, aluminium smelting and refining, bauxite and nepheline ore mining and processing, as well as sales of bauxite, alumina and various primary aluminium and secondary products. There were no significant changes in the Group’s principal activities for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

UC RUSAL produced 1.808 million tonnes of aluminium in the six months ended 30 June 2015, compared to 1.783 million tonnes in the same period of 2014. The production increase of 25,000 tonnes (1.4%) was mostly due to the value-added products share increase at Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter and the end of capacity downtime at Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter and Irkutsk aluminium smelter. Alumina production was stable, amounting to 3.626 million tonnes in the six months ended 30 June 2015, up 0.2% from 3.618 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2014. Bauxite production grew by 1.5% to 5.971 million tonnes7 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 from 5.885 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June Aluminium foil and packaging material production by the Group’s plants totaled 44,647 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015, down 1.7% from 45,433 tonnes in the six months ended 30 June 2014. For the purposes of calculating Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio as at 30 June 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was annualised by multiplying Adjusted EBITDA for the period by two. This ratio may not be indicative of what this ratio will be for the full fiscal year ending 31 December 2015. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA differs from Total Net Debt to Covenant EBITDA for the purposes of the Company’s credit facility agreements. UC RUSAL’s output from its non-core business recorded the following results in the first half of 2015 compared to the respective period of the previous year. Product mix optimization, equipment Coal production attributable to the Group’s 50% share in LLP Bogatyr Komir decreased by 2.8% to 7.830 million tonnes in the first half of 2015 from 8.057 million tonnes in the first half of 2014, largely due to weaker demand in Russia. The aggregate products transported by LLP Bogatyr Trans, in which the Company has a 50% share, decreased by 15.7% to 2.683 million tonnes in the first half 2015 from 3.184 million tonnes in the first half of 2014 due to a decrease in coal demand and change in transportation structure. Six months ended 30 June 2015 Six months ended 30 June 2014 (USD/t) (USD/t) Sales of primary aluminium and Three months ended 30 June 2015 Three months ended 31 March 2015 (USD/t) (USD/t) Sales of primary aluminium and Including energy and bauxite. Revenue increased by USD366 million, or 8.3% to USD4,750 million in the first six months of 2015, from USD4,384 million in the corresponding period of 2014. The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth of sales of primary aluminium and alloys, which accounted for 84.9% and 82.8% of UC RUSAL’s revenue for the first six months of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue from sales of primary aluminium and alloys increased by USD400 million, or 11.0% to USD4,032 million in the first six months of 2015, from USD3,632 million for the corresponding period in 2014. This growth resulted primarily from a 6.4% increase in the weighted average realised aluminium price per tonne, which was driven by an increase in the LME aluminium price (to an average of USD1,785 per tonne in the first half of 2015 from USD1,753 per tonne in the same period of 2014); an increase in premiums over the LME price in different geographical segments (to an average of USD367 per tonne from USD347 per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and 2014, respectively); as well as a slight increase in physical sales of 76,000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014. The Company’s revenue from sales of primary aluminium and alloys decreased by 12.5% to USD1,882 million in the second quarter of 2015 from USD2,150 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenues resulted from a 5.0% drop in primary aluminium and alloys sales volumes, as well as a 27.8% decrease in the realised premiums above LME prices from USD424 in the first quarter of 2015 to USD306 in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue from sales of alumina grew by 15.6% to USD304 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD263 million in the corresponding period of 2014 as the average sales price rose by 15.6%. Revenue from sales of aluminium foil decreased by 4.7% to USD142 million in the first six months of 2015, from USD149 million for the corresponding period of 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the average realised sales prices. Revenue from other sales, including sales of bauxite and energy services decreased by 20.0% to USD272 million for the first six months of 2015 from USD340 million in the same period of 2014, due to a 16.0% drop in sales of bauxite and a 14.3% decrease in sales of other materials. Note: Data based on location of customers, which may differ from the location of final consumers. The table below shows the breakdown of the Group’s revenues by geographic segment for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014, showing the percentage of revenue attributable to each region: Six months ended Change, year-on- Share of costs,% (Six Change, costs,% (Three months 30 June 31 March quarter- on- 30 June (3.4%) (11.6%) (10.8%) Cost of other raw (13.9%) (10.1%) (8.2%) (3.7%) Depreciation and (5.3%) (32.1%) Repairs and (41.2%) (33.3%) Net change in (11.9%) 100.0 % (5.7%) The following table shows the breakdown of UC RUSAL’s cost of sales for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 and for the three months ended 30 June 2015 and 31 March Total cost of sales decreased by 11.9%, to USD3,221 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015, from USD3,656 million for the corresponding period of 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by the continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar by 64.1% and 107.7%, respectively, between the reporting periods, which was partially offset by the increase in volumes of primary aluminium and alloys sold. Cost of alumina was almost flat during the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period of Cost of bauxite decreased by 10.8% in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period of the previous year due to a 7.1% drop in purchased volume, which was partially offset by a slight increase in purchase prices. Cost of raw materials (other than alumina and bauxite) and other costs decreased by 13.9% in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period of the previous year due to lower raw materials purchase prices (including 19.2% lower for raw petroleum coke, 17.6% for raw pitch coke and 4.37% for calcined petroleum coke). Energy cost decreased by 8.2% in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014, primarily due to the continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar that more than offset a 50.8% increase in the average electricity tariff. Cost of sales decreased by 5.7%, to USD1,563 million in the second quarter of 2015 from USD1,658 million in the previous quarter, primarily as a result of a 5.0% decrease in the volumes of primary aluminium and alloys sold. Distribution expenses decreased by 21.4% to USD162 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD206 million for the same period of the previous year, primarily due to the decrease in transportation tariffs as well as the significant depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar. Administrative expenses, which include personnel costs, decreased by 4.4% to USD280 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD293 million for the corresponding period in 2014 following the depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar. Other operating expenses decreased by 52.9% to USD32 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD68 million for the corresponding period in 2014, primarily due to the reduction of provisions and the depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar. As a result of the foregoing factors, UC RUSAL reported a gross profit of USD1,529 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 compared to USD728 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014, representing an increase in gross profit margin to 32.2% in the reporting period compared to 16.6% in the corresponding period of 2014. Change, Add: (0.9%) (42.9%) (66.7%) As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company demonstrated a significant increase in results from operating activities and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2015, to USD1,021 million and USD1,289 million respectively, from USD99 million and USD393 million respectively for the same period of 2014. Change, (13.1%) (8.4%) (42.6%) (41.9%) (46.2%) (41.4%) (5.7%) Finance income was almost flat in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Finance expenses fell by USD36 million or 5.7% to USD601 million for the first six months of 2015 from USD637 million for the same period of 2014 due to the decrease in interest expenses, bank charges and the net loss from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, partially offset by an increase in the foreign exchange loss. The net loss from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments shrank to USD72 million for the first six months of 2015 from USD124 million for the same period of 2014 as a result of the Russian Ruble’s significant depreciation against the US dollar, which led to the revaluation of certain cross-currency instruments. Interest expenses on bank and company loans for the first half of 2015 dropped by USD51 million to USD338 million from USD389 million for the first half of 2014 due to a decrease in bank charges, as well as the reduction of the principal amount payable to international and Russian lenders and an overall interest margin between the periods. The growth of the net foreign exchange loss to USD184 million for the first six months of 2015 from USD117 million for the same period of 2014 was driven by the continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar and the resulting revaluation of working capital items of several Group companies denominated in foreign currencies. Change, year-on- (19.7%) (60.0%) (21.9%) Share of profits of associates increased to USD440 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD361 million in the corresponding period of 2014. Share of profits of associates in both periods resulted primarily from the Company’s investment in Norilsk Nickel. As stated in note 10 to the consolidated interim condensed financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2015, at the date of this consolidated interim condensed financial information, the Group was unable to obtain the consolidated interim financial information of Norilsk Nickel as at and for the three- and six-month periods ended 30 June 2015. Consequently the Group estimated its share of the profits, foreign currency translation and other comprehensive income of Norilsk Nickel for the period ended 30 June 2015 based on the latest publicly available information reported by Norilsk Nickel. The information used as a basis for these estimates is incomplete in many aspects. Once the consolidated interim financial information for Norilsk Nickel becomes available, it will be compared to management’s estimates. If there are significant differences, adjustments may be required to restate the Group’s share of profit, foreign currency translation, other comprehensive income and the carrying value of the investment in Norilsk Nickel that has been previously reported. Share of losses of joint ventures was USD6 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to a profit of USD15 million for the same period in 2014. This represents the Company’s share of results in joint ventures, namely BEMO, LLP Bogatyr Komir, Mega Business and Alliance (transportation business in Kazakhstan) and North United Aluminium Shenzhen Co., Ltd (“North United Aluminium”). On 11 March 2015, the Supreme Court of Ukraine denied the Group’s appeal to reconsider a previous court decision that 68% of shares of PJSC Zaporozhye Aluminium Combine (“ZALK”), an indirect subsidiary of UC RUSAL, should be deprivatized and returned to the State of Ukraine. On 9 June 2015 these shares were transferred to the State Property Fund of Ukraine. The Company intends to pursue all available legal alternatives, including, but not limited to, the European Court of Human Rights, to overturn the above decision. However as a result of the Supreme Court ruling the Group no longer has the rights to varying returns from ZALK or the ability to control this entity to affect those returns. The assets and liabilities of ZALK have been deconsolidated, which resulted in the recognition of a USD9 million gain in this consolidated interim condensed financial information. Additionally, USD155 million of foreign currency translation gain arising on the translation of ZALK accumulated from 2007 was recycled through profit and loss. As a result of the foregoing factors, the Company’s profit before taxation was USD1,026 million for the first six months of 2015, compared to a loss of USD150 million for the corresponding period of Income tax expense increased by USD88 million to USD147 million in the first six months of 2015 from USD59 million for the corresponding period in 2014. Current tax expenses increased by USD79 million to USD142 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 from USD63 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014, primarily due to an increase in the taxable profit period-on-period. As a result of the above, the Company recorded a profit of USD879 million for the first half of 2015, compared to a loss of USD209 million for the same period of 2014. Change, year-on- Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Profit/(Loss) Adjusted for: liabilities, net of tax (20%) (34.5%) (100.0%) (42.9%) Adjusted Net Profit/(Loss) Add back: Recurring Net Profit/(Loss) Adjusted Net Profit/(Loss) for any period is defined as the Net Profit/(Loss) adjusted for the net effect of the Company’s investment in Norilsk Nickel, the net effect of derivative financial instruments and the net effect of impairment of non-current assets. Recurring Net Profit/(Loss) for any period is defined as Adjusted Net Profit/(Loss) plus the Company’s net effective share in Norilsk Nickel’s results. The Group has four reportable segments, as described in the 2014 Annual Report, which are the Group’s strategic business units: Aluminium, Alumina, Energy and Mining and Metals. These business units are managed separately and results of their operations are reviewed by the CEO on a regular basis. The core segments are Aluminium and Alumina. (6.3%) Segment EBITDA for any period is defined as segment result adjusted for The segment result margin (calculated as a percentage of segment profit to total segment revenue per respective segment) from continuing operations rose to 27.7% in the six months ended 30 June 2015 from 10.0% in the same period a year earlier for the aluminium segment, and was positive 8.9% compared to negative 10.6%, respectively, for the alumina segment. Key drivers for the increase in margin in the aluminium segment are disclosed in “Cost of sales” and “Results from operations and Adjusted EBITDA” above. Detailed segment reporting can be found in the consolidated interim condensed financial information included in this Interim Report. amortisation and depreciation for the segment. The following table sets forth the Group’s current assets, current liabilities and working capital as at the dates indicated: The Group had working capital of USD1,491 million as at 30 June 2015, up by 9.4% from USD1,363 million as at 31 December 2014. Inventories decreased by USD82 million, or 4.1%, to USD1,916 million as at 30 June 2015 from USD1,998 million as at 31 December 2014. This decrease was primarily due to negative raw material prices performance, continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble, as well as volume variance. Trade and other receivables increased by USD86 million, or 12.5%, to USD772 million at 30 June 2015 from USD686 million at 31 December 2014, due to an increase in trade receivables from third parties. Trade and other payables decreased by USD124 million, or 9.4%, to USD1,197 million at 30 June 2015 from USD1,321 million at 31 December 2014. The drop was primarily attributable to a decrease in advances received from the Group’s main customers. UC RUSAL recorded capital expenditure (which constitute payments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) of USD217 million in the first half of 2015 (including pot rebuilds for USD56 million). UC RUSAL’s capital expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was primarily aimed at maintaining existing production facilities. The table below shows the breakdown of UC RUSAL’s capital expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and 2014: Maintenance CAPEX, including: The nominal value of the Group’s loans and borrowings was USD9,050 million as at 30 June 2015, not including bonds which amounted to an additional USD28 million.

On 6 April 2015, the Company’s subsidiary RUSAL Bratsk announced a coupon rate under the series 08 bonds at the level of 12% p.a. for a two-year period, after which the series 08 bonds will be subject to a put option and coupon rate revision. On 15 April 2015, the Company’s subsidiary RUSAL Bratsk fulfilled its obligations under a bondholders’ put option in regard to the series 08 bonds. 8,067,213 of the issued bonds were repurchased from bondholders at the bondholders’ request. As of 31 March 2015, the Total Net Debt to Covenant EBITDA ratio (the leverage ratio) was below a level of 3.5.

At the Company’s request this transaction was terminated early in full and settled on 30 June 2015.

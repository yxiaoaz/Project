During the Review Period, limited raw coal production volume was contributed to further manufacture of clean coal for sales during the coal mines consolidation in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. Also, the further slowdown in the demand from steel manufacturers led to the decrease in the average selling price. The sales volume of clean coal amounted to approximately 201,800 tonnes as compared to approximately 273,900 tonnes in the corresponding period in 2014, representing a decrease of 26.3%. The average selling price (net of value added tax) of clean coal amounted to approximately RMB748.8 per tonne as compared to approximately RMB863.3 per tonne in the corresponding period in 2014, representing a decrease of approximately 13.3%. Accordingly, the Company has commenced trading of magnetic iron powder of approximately RMB188.9 million in order to supplement its coking coal business.

The following table illustrates the production volume of the principal products in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and the purchase volume of principal products for the respective period. (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) Material, fuel and power costs during the Review Period were approximately RMB316.5 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB123.6 million, or approximately 64.1%, as compared with approximately RMB192.9 million in corresponding period in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the purchase of magnetic iron powder of approximately RMB188.8 million for trading purpose. The material, fuel and power costs of approximately RMB127.7 million relating to the mining business represented a decrease of 33.8% as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the decrease in both the production volume of raw coal and clean coal, and (ii) the decrease in unit mining cost since less spending on materials, fuel and power consumptions but offset by the increase in clean coal production cost as more raw coal consumed during coal washing. Besides, approximately 26,000 tonnes of clean coal were purchased from outsiders for sales during the Review Period. Staff costs during the Review Period were approximately RMB41.2 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB2.4 million, or approximately 5.5%, as compared with approximately RMB43.6 million in the corresponding period of 2014.

The decrease in aggregate losses was mainly attributable to (i) the turnaround from exchange loss of approximately RMB29.6 million in the corresponding period in 2014 to exchange gain of approximately RMB83,000 during the period and (ii) the decrease in impairment loss recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment of approximately RMB678.6 million arising from the coal mine consolidation in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces but offset by the decrease in gain on disposal of available-for-sale investments of approximate RMB36.4 million. Distribution expenses during the Review Period were approximately RMB19.6 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB12.3 million or approximately 38.6%, as compared to approximately RMB31.9 million in the corresponding period of 2014. The decrease was in line with the decrease in sales volume of the Group’s principal products. Administrative expenses during the Review Period were approximately RMB107.0 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB50.4 million or approximately 32.0%, as compared to approximately RMB157.4 million in corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the cost saving in staff costs of approximately RMB22.7 million and legal and professional expenses of approximately RMB18.6 million respectively as a result of the reinforcement or structural reform and reduction of administrative expenses. Finance costs during the Review Period amounted to approximately RMB223.2 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB51.3 million or approximately 18.7%, as compared with approximately RMB274.5 million in corresponding period in 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease in interest payable to advances drawn on bills receivable discounted of approximately RMB27.5 million and (ii) a decrease in interest expenses on senior notes of approximately RMB52.1 million after the tender offer to purchase for cash of approximately 51.91% of the total aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes in 2014 but set off with (i) a decrease of interest capitalised on construction in progress of approximately RMB14.6 million and (ii) an increase in interest payable to bank and other borrowings of approximately RMB13.9 million.

In the corresponding period in 2014, the Company recorded a tax debit of approximately RMB161.0 million, mainly representing a deferred tax debit of approximately RMB161.9 million mainly arising from the tax impact on the impairment of property, plant and equipment. For the current year EIT, the effective tax rate is considered to be not comparable as there was significant tax effect of tax losses not recognized resulting from loss incurred in certain subsidiaries of the Company. As a result of the foregoing, the loss attributable to the owners of the Company during the Review Period was approximately RMB390.5 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB577.7 million or approximately 59.7%, as compared with approximately RMB968.2 million in the corresponding period in 2014.

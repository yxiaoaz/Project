In the first half of 2015, Honworld Group Limited (the “Company” together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) focused its product sales and promotion strategy on increasing its cooking wine sales and taking market leadership position, as well as refining the quality and product mix of its other products. It is expected that the stock of base wine to reach 225 million liters by the end of the 2015 fermentation season (June 2016). The Company has sufficient base wine to increase its market shares by volume and value. In the first half of 2015, the Company successfully introduced three types of bottled and four types of bagged original cooking wine specifically designed for the county and city level local distribution channels covering supermarkets, local community stores, agricultural and food markets, in response to our expansion strategy to third tier and fourth tier cities. We also launched a series of zero additive cooking wine, zero additive Stewed Mushroom Dark Soy Sauce ( ) and Premium Flavored Soy Sauce ( ) for the supermarkets distribution channels. To the Company’s knowledge, Lao Heng He’s Stewed Mushroom Dark Soy Sauce is the only dark soy sauce product without caramel color additives which has a patent application number in the PRC. It uses non-genetically modified soybeans and the production process involves no caramel colour additives, achieves the true healthy soy sauce. The Company introduced fragrance condiments series, large packaging cooking wine, soy sauce and rice vinegar series specifically designed for the food and beverage distribution channels. Lao Heng He’s cooking wine products are leading product categories in major supermarkets and stores. In the first half of 2015, while we continue to expand our market shares in the tradition channels of supermarkets and stores, the Company made efforts in building channels in the food and beverage distribution channels, third tier and fourth tier cities distribution channels and E-commerce distribution channels. For the expansion in the third tier and fourth tier cities, the Company has successfully developed more than 100 new county-level distributors in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Beijing, Hebei and Liaoning. At the beginning of 2015, the Company has organized an E-commerce team. The Company’s direct e-stores on Jingdong, Taobao, Tmall and Yihaodian have all commenced their operations. For the six months ended 30 June 2015, revenue of the Group amounted to RMB356.7 million (six months ended 30 June 2014: RMB297.5 million), representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The key financial indicators of the Group are as follows: Period- to-period Earnings per share (RMB cents) (Note a) Gross profit margin (%) (0.2%) Net profit margin attributable to owners of the Company (%) EBITDA margin (%) Gearing ratio (Note b) Notes: (a) Please refer to Note 8 to the financial statements for the calculation of earnings per share. (b) The gearing ratio was based on net debt divided by total equity and net debt. Net debt includes total debt net of cash and cash equivalents. (a) (b) During the six months ended 30 June 2015, the revenue of the Group increased by 20.0% from RMB297.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB356.7 million for the corresponding period of 2015, primarily reflecting an increase in the sales of our cooking wine products, soy sauce products and vinegar products. Revenue from cooking wine products increased by 19.9% from RMB215.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB258.6 million for the corresponding period of 2015, reflecting an increase in average selling prices and sales volume for all product lines except for our mass-market cooking wine products. In particular, the demand for our premium and high-end cooking wine products such as Chef’s Huadiao ( ), Well-aged Cooking Wine ( ), 15% ABV Cooking Wine (15 ) and Steamed Fish Cooking Wine ( ), grew even faster. Revenue from the Group’s soy sauce products increased by 17.4% from RMB47.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB55.4 million for the corresponding period of 2015, reflecting an increase in sales volume for the Group’s soy sauce products like Premium Flavored Soy Sauce ( ) and Stewed Mushroom Dark Soy Sauce ( ). Revenue from the Group’s vinegar products increased by 50.0% from RMB23.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB34.8 million for the corresponding period of 2015, reflecting an increase in sale volume for the Group’s naturally-brewed vinegar products, such as Rose Rice Vinegar ( ), Crab Vinegar ( ) and Premium Zhejiang Vinegar ( ). The Group’s shift in focus to the cooking wine business affected the revenue from the Group’s other products, which decreased by 30.7% from RMB11.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB7.9 million for the corresponding period of 2015. The Group believes the outstanding performance of the Group’s sales is largely contributed to (i) increasing market recognition of the “Lao Heng He” (“ ”) brand; (ii) consistent superior quality of the “Lao Heng He” (“ ”) products; (iii) enhancing efforts on the Group’s marketing and promotion activities; (iv) rising disposable income level in the PRC; (v) growing consumer consciousness of food safety and preference for naturally-brewed cooking wine products which the Group introduced to the market; and (vi) vertical penetration of the Group’s distribution network to third tier and fourth tier cities. The Group’s cost of sales, include raw materials, manufacturing overhead and salaries and benefits, increased by 20.2% from RMB128.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB154.4 million for the corresponding period of 2015, largely in line with the revenue growth. As a result of the foregoing, the Group’s gross profit increased by 19.7% from RMB168.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB202.2 million for the corresponding period of 2015, and the gross profit margin decreased slightly from 56.8% in the six months ended 30 June 2014 to 56.7% for the corresponding period of 2015. Selling and distribution expenses primarily consisted of advertising expenses, marketing expenses, travelling expenses, and remuneration for our sales employees. The Group’s selling and distribution expenses increased from RMB16.5 million during the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB18.9 million for the corresponding period of 2015, which was mainly in line with the increase in revenue. The Group’s selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of the Group’s revenue decreased from 5.5% for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to 5.3% for the corresponding period of 2015, primarily as a result of the Group’s continued efforts to adjust its marketing and promotional spending away from regions and advertising channels where marketing and promotion expenditure had lower returns. The administrative expenses increased by 9.3% from RMB36.4 million during the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB39.8 million for the corresponding period of 2015, mainly due to the increase in research and development expenses for new fermentation methods and new processing methods of base wine and base soy sauce to improve their nutrition and flavor. Finance costs increased by 33.0% from RMB11.5 million during the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB15.3 million for the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in finance costs primarily reflected an increase in average bank loans to fulfill the increased purchase of raw material for the expanded production capacity in the first half year of 2015. As a result of the foregoing, the profit before tax increased by 21.6% from RMB106.8 million during the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB129.9 million for the corresponding period of 2015. As mentioned above, the subsidiaries of the Company in China, Huzhou Laohenghe Brewery Co. Limited and Huzhou Laohenghe Wine Co., Limited, having received the “Certificate of New and Advanced Technology Enterprise”, are entitled to the beneficial tax rate of 15% for three years starting from 1 January 2013. As such, the corporate income tax of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2015 in respect of its operations in the PRC was provided at the rate of 15% (six months ended 30 June 2014: 15%) on the taxable profits. Income tax expenses increased by 17.8% from RMB16.9 million during the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB19.9 million for the corresponding period of 2015, which was mainly due to the increase in profit before tax. The effective income tax rate was 15.4% and 15.8% for the first half year of 2015 and the corresponding period of 2014, respectively. Profit for the period attributable to owners of the Profit attributable to owners of the Company increased by about 22.4% from RMB89.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB110.0 million for the corresponding period of 2015. Basic earnings per share increased from RMB18.2 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to RMB21.2 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and net profit margin increased from 30.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2014 to 30.8% for the corresponding period of 2015. Increase in earnings per share was attributable to increase of revenue and stable net profit margin attributable to owners of the Company. A substantial part of the inventories of the Group was contributed by work-in- progress, which mainly represented the base wine, base soy sauce and base vinegar in the brewing period. The inventory turnover days increased from 749 days during the year of 2014 to 1,071 days during the first half year of 2015, which was primarily a result of significant increase in work-in-progress by RMB193.2 million, or 24.7%. In order to cope with the continuing increase in demand for the cooking wine, soy sauce and vinegar products, the Group expanded its production scale significantly, and the stock of base wine, base soy sauce and base vinegar all recorded a significant increase, to ensure the Group has sufficient work-in-progress stock not only for the short-term product, but also for the expansion in the next few years. Trade receivables primarily represented the receivables for goods sold to the distributors. Trade receivables turnover days increased from 76 days for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 90 days for the six months ended 30 June 2015, which primarily reflects an increase of sales attributable to Category A and Category B distributors as a percentage of total sales, as these distributors generally have longer credit terms than distributors in other categories, coupled with a decrease of sales attributable to Category C and D distributors as a percentage of total sales, as Category C and D distributors generally have to pay in full upon delivery. Trade payables represented payables to suppliers for raw materials, like rice, wheat, bean and others. Trade payables turnover days increased from 65 days for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 106 days for the six months ended 30 June 2015, primarily reflecting our increasing bargaining power against our suppliers as our purchase volume increased as a result of our business expansion. Capital commitment as at 30 June 2015 amounted to approximately RMB14.0 million (30 June 2014: RMB14.4 million), which was mainly related to construction in progress for expansion of plant and advertising contracts for marketing events. As at 30 June 2015, the Group did not have any material contingent liability. As at 30 June 2015, the Group’s inventories with a carrying amount of RMB194.5 million (31 December 2014: RMB117.5 million), property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of RMB20.0 million (31 December 2014: RMB20.6 million) and leasehold land with a carrying amount of RMB11.4 million (31 December 2014: RMB11.5 million) were pledged to secure bank loans granted to the Group. Except as disclosed in this report, the Group has not entered into any off- balance sheet guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third party. It does not have any interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to it or engages in leasing or hedging or research and development or other services with it. Inventories increased from RMB830.5 million as of 31 December 2014 to RMB995.3 million as of 30 June 2015 primarily due to increase in work in progress, which in turn reflected increased production of base wine, base soy sauce and base vinegar. The Group monitors the level of inventory maintained by its distributors on a regular basis. The Group’s sales representatives maintain frequent telephone or email communications with each of its Categories A, B, C and D distributors, review their monthly inventory reports and visit their warehouses on a regular basis. The Group’s sales representatives visit its Category A and B distributors’ warehouses at least every three months to ensure that they keep optimal stock level and the Groups products are sold to end customers within the shell life. The Group generally expects its distributors to maintain stock sufficient for 5 to 20 days of supply. In the event a distributor maintains stocks of more than 20 days of supply, the relevant sales representatives will assist such distributor in marketing and promotional activities and suggest smaller sized orders to be placed for the succeeding periods to minimize excess inventory. As at 30 June 2015, the Group’s total bank borrowings amounted to RMB528.7 million (31 December 2014: RMB417.8 million). The Group’s principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from business operations, bank and other borrowings. The cash from these sources are primarily used for the Group’s working capital and the expansion of production capacity. The Group conducted its business primarily in China with the majority of its revenue and expenditures denominated in Renminbi. The Group does not have a foreign currency hedging policy. However, the management will monitor the situation and will consider hedging any significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise. We expect the uncertainty in the Chinese economy will prevail into the second half of 2015 due to the complicated internal and external environments. However, the “slower growth and structural improvement” policy guidance on the Chinese economy being gradually enforced, together with the increasingly prominent role of consumption, will both further unveil the potentials hidden in the consumer market. Therefore, we feel optimistic on the outlook of the Chinese economy and on our industry. The Company’s soy sauce workshop will start its renovation and expansion in the second half of 2015, which will further increase our production capacity of soy sauce. Our zero additive Stewed Mushroom Dark Soy Sauce ( ) and Premium Flavored Soy Sauce ( ) will be able to be distributed to more distribution channels and regions. While we continuously focusing on sale of premium and high-end products, the Company will make more efforts in building up distribution channels in the third and fourth tier counties and cities in Eastern China, Southern China, Northern China and Northeastern China in the second half of 2015 and keep on expanding the vertical coverage of our sale network. For market segmentation, the Company will develop distribution network based on towns, counties and cities. The Company vigorously promoted the channel building efforts in subdivided regions, and planned to increase its distributors to 400 and employ around 100 more sales representatives by the end of 2015.

The Company recorded an unaudited loss of US$650,128 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 (six months ended 30 June 2014: profit of US$4,168,159). Such loss was mainly attributable to unrealised fair value loss in the Company’s investment in Global Market Group Limited (“GMG”), which is currently listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange since 22 June 2012. The market price of GMG increased steadily in the first half of 2014 after a share buy-back scheme and business cooperation with Guangzhou Daily Group. However, due to operating losses in the second half, GMG’s share price gradually dropped slightly, coupled with the weakness of GBP exchange rate, the fair value of GMG as at 30 June 2015 dropped 23.45% as compared with that of 30 June 2014 (approximately 8.3% since 31 December 2014). The Company recorded a fair value loss of US$621,357 on GMG for the six-months ended 30 June 2015 (six months ended 30 June 2014: fair value gain of US$4,409,503). The Company’s unlisted investment in the private placement shares in C-Media Electronics Inc. (“C-Media”) successfully got listed on the Taiwan GreTai Securities Market on 3 June 2015. Accordingly, the unlisted investment in C-Media has been re-classified as listed investment. The Investment Manager has been closely monitoring C-Media’s price performance and prevailing market conditions to gradually cash out on this investment. Up to 30 June 2015, the Company has sold 70% of its holding in C-Media and recorded realised profits of US$142,898 for the period ended 30 June 2015. The Company recorded realised gain of US$98,583 (six months ended 30 June 2014: US$94,101 loss) on disposal of listed securities for the six months ended 30 June 2015. Owing to concerns about the uncertain domestic economic growth prospects and stability of the stock market, the Company continued to persist in a conservative investment strategy, which lowered market risk exposures. As a result the Company’s listed securities portfolio benefited less from the Hong Kong stocks’ boom in April 2015 and recorded a 4.38% gain in the first half. Dividend income from listed securities of US$29,057 was recorded in the reporting period as compared to US$12,815 in the last corresponding period. The Company paid its shareholders a special final dividend of US$0.10 per share in June 2015. As at 30 June 2015, the Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share was US$1.26 as compared with US$1.43 at the end of 2014; such decrease was mainly due to dividend payment and unrealised loss in the fair value of GMG. Affected by factors such as weak overseas demand, excess capacity and deleveraging, Chinese economy remained weak in the first half of 2015. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth rate was only 7.0% in the first quarter, which was the lowest in the last 24 quarters. In the second quarter, despite continued slowdown in indicators of main sectors such as investment, consumption, exports and industrial production, GDP growth was still maintained at 7.0%. Overall, GDP grew by 7.0% year- on-year during the first half of 2015. The Chinese Government focused on boosting domestic demand through stimulating consumption and investments coupled with accelerated approval and construction process of major infrastructure projects, promoted local government debt swaps and encouraged public entrepreneurship, e-commerce and consumer finance developments. Further policies are expected to be implemented to fine-tune economic structure and open the market with continued reforms of state-owned enterprises. In terms of monetary policy, the Central Bank is expected to maintain accommodative monetary environment in lowering corporate financing cost through cutting reserve rate and interest rate. Looking ahead to the third quarter, as a result of growth stabilisation policies, less constraints on capital and low base effect, the Chinese economy may likely stabilise with a slight rally. However, with fundamentals to recovery remaining weak and continuing large downward pressure, implementation of growth stabilisation policies are expected to continue. Relevant stock markets’ performance in the first half of 2015 During the first half of 2015, Hong Kong stocks fluctuated upwards in the first quarter, rocketed up in April, but then fell into a bearish slide in May. At the beginning of April, the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) announced that mutual funds were allowed to directly invest in designated Hong Kong stocks through the “Hong Kong Stock Market Direct Access” Scheme without Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (“QDII”) qualifications. Meanwhile, pushed by abundant liquidity conditions and high reform expectations, the Shanghai Composite Index rose steadily to reach 5,000 points. The widely anticipated eventual approval of capital interconnection policies led by the “Shenzhen Hong Kong Mutual Market Access” Scheme at one stage made the Hong Kong market sentiment extremely fevered. However, utilisation of “Hong Kong Stock Market Direct Access” Scheme quota was lower than expectations. On the other hand, CSRC’s overly aggressive deleverage measures created a domino effect, which caused successive huge slump in A shares, even the “double cut” policies published by People’s Bank of China in order to stabilise investor sentiment proved to be ineffective. As a result, Hong Kong stocks entered into a confirmed downward fluctuation slide. As of 30 June 2015, the Hang Seng Index closed at 26,250 points, still up by 11.21% compared to 23,605 points at the end of last year. Owing to concerns about the uncertain domestic economic growth prospects and stability of the stock market, the Company continued to persist in a conservative investment strategy, which lowered market risk exposures. As a result the Company’s listed securities portfolio benefited less from the Hong Kong stocks’ boom in April 2015 and recorded a 4.38% gain in the first half. Global Market Group Limited (“GMG”) The Company invested in GMG Preferred Shares for a consideration of US$5 million in March 2008. In June 2010, the Company reinvested its dividend entitlement of US$847,458 for additional GMG Preferred Shares to increase its equity interest to 9.67%. GMG’s ordinary shares are currently listed on the AIM of the London Stock Exchange. As at 30 June 2015, a total of 8,734,897 ordinary shares of GMG are held by the Company, representing 9.36% of GMG’s total issued ordinary shares. GMG is a leading B2B internet trading service provider in the PRC. It focuses on providing an international trading service platform for high-end quality export manufacturers in China and international buyers. Currently, its internet trading service consists of M2B and M2C businesses. During the two-year strategic adjustment period running from 2013 to 2014, over 30,000 manufacturers have been users of GMG. Gross revenue increased by 13.9% for the year ended 31 December 2014, wherein, GMG recorded revenue growth of 4.4% in M2B segment, online platform transactions increased by 40.6% and registered buyers increased 15% to 13.6 million. Despite achieving revenue growth, due to huge investment in developing Feifei (www.feifei.com), GMG recorded net losses in GMG invested US$12.9 million in Feifei. With the continuing support of Guangzhou Daily Group, FeiFei will transit its business model from an M2C to M2B2C model and focus more on serving the manufacturers, improving user experience and building up a service which will address the whole supply chain. As at 30 June 2015, the market price of GMG was £0.50 per share (31 December 2014: £0.55), representing a fair value of US$6,862,135. The Investment Manager considers that GMG’s current stock price still does not reflect its intrinsic value and will continue to monitor closely for appropriate exit opportunity. C-Media Electronics Inc. (“C-Media”) In May 2010, the Company participated in a private placement launched by C-Media by subscribing for 1 million new shares therein at an investment cost of US$1.2 million approximately, whose common shares are listed on the Taiwan GreTai Securities Market (stock code 6237.TT). The Company recorded these private placement shares as unlisted investment. Following the release of lock-up restriction of the private placement shares in May 2013, C-Media achieved satisfactory net profits and return on equity level in the year 2014 and therefore became qualified to list. The private shares commenced trading on Taiwan GreTai Securities Market effective on 3 June 2015. Accordingly, the Company’s unlisted investment in C-Media is re-classified as listed investment. The Investment Manager has been closely monitoring C-Media’s price performance and prevailing market conditions to gradually cash out on this investment. Up to 30 June 2015, the Company sold 70% of its holding in C-Media and recorded realised profits of US$142,898. As at 30 June 2015, the Company was holding 300,000 shares in C-Media, representing a market value of US$248,275. The Investment Manager studied several potential projects in the first half of 2015 in various sectors such as healthcare and mobile games etc. However, the Company did not make any new investments in view of limited cash resources. It is believed that China will experience deeper and more comprehensive market reform and economic transition in the second half of 2015. Financial systems reforms such as IPO registration system and marketisation of interest rate will gradually tackle the problem of capital flow inefficiency, help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to obtain finance and increase the efficiency of social assets allocation. Local Debt-Swap Plan is implemented to reduce debt systematic risk. Reform of state- owned enterprises will continue to increase their efficiency. At the same time, Chinese economy is transforming to an innovative economy, which is led by the new concept of “Internet +” to create new growth drivers and core competencies of national economy. However, many risk factors of common concern still exist. From a domestic perspective, Chinese economy has slowed down significantly. The prospects of reform are as yet unclear while local governments and corporates debt level remain high. Deleveraging of stock market has yet to be completed with the stability of financial system still at risk. From a global perspective, increase in interest rate in the US has been widely anticipated; economic growth of Europe is weak with debt crisis of Greece failed to be tackled properly. Opportunities and risks both exist in the Hong Kong market. From a horizontal view, valuation of Hong Kong stock market is attractive. However, only if domestic and global risks are relieved, can Hong Kong stock market attract more global capital to increase asset allocation. In the long run, Chinese capital is expected to choose Hong Kong as the primary bridgehead for capital outflow. The Investment Manager has been actively looking for exit opportunities for C-Media and GMG, both of them are unlisted at the time of investment. C-Media was fully exited with realised profits at end of July 2015. On the listed securities front, the management team of the Investment Manager will continue to monitor the best timing to gradually overweight industries that will be reform beneficiaries and supported by state policies, such as healthcare, technology, media and telecom, and the finance sector. The Company will continue to adhere to its prudent investment strategy and always be aware of the risks.

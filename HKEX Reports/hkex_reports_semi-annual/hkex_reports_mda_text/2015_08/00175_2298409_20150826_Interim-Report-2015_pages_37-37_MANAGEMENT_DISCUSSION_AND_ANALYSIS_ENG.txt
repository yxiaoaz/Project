reviewed by the Board’s audit committee, comprising solely the independent non-executive directors of the Company, one of whom chairs the committee, and the Company’s auditors, Grant Thornton Hong Kong Limited. The Group’s performance in the first half of 2015 met the management’s expectations. Our domestic sales continued to recover, helped by the good market response to new models like “New Emgrand” and “New Vision”. This is despite the sluggish automobile market in China and the challenges remained in some of the Group’s major export markets. Sales performance of Chinese indigenous brand passenger vehicles improved during the period, with their overall sales volume growing 14.6% year-on-year (“YoY”) in the first half of 2015, compared with the 4.8% YoY growth of the overall China passenger vehicle market, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. As a result of the Group’s restructuring of the sales and marketing system in 2014, the Group’s sales performance in the China market maintained its strong momentum, with the total sales volume up 53.1% YoY to 233,990 units in the first half of 2015. The Group’s export sales volume, however, slid 48.1% YoY to 17,883 units in the first half of 2015 due to the challenging market environment in some of the Group’s major export markets in Africa and Eastern Europe, principally caused by the relative strength of RMB exchange rates and political and economic instability in these countries. The Group sold a total of 251,873 units of vehicles in the first six months of 2015, achieved a 34.5% YoY growth in the period under review. Total revenues increased by 36% to RMB13,807 million during the period. Profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company for the first half of 2015 was up 26% to RMB1,405 million compared to the first half of 2014. In the first half of 2015, benefits from lower automobile component costs were more than offset by the increased sales volume of newly launched models like “New Emgrand”, “New Vision” and “Geely GC9”, which usually carry lower margins at the early stage of product cycle, resulted in lower gross margin ratio during the period. This, together with higher selling and distribution expenses, mainly caused by higher promotional expenses for new models, resulted in only moderate growth in net profit. Fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) was up 26% to RMB15.90 cents. As a result of higher revenues and operating profits in the first half of 2015, the Group’s financial position continued to be strong at the end of the first half of 2015. The Group’s total cash level (cash and bank balances + pledged bank deposits) increased by 9% from the end of 2014 to RMB7,888 million at the end of June 2015, while its total borrowings (including bank borrowings and senior notes) decreased by 16% to RMB2,107 million during the same period. Net cash on hand (total cash level – bank borrowings – senior notes) amounted to RMB5,781 million, the highest level in the Group’s history, versus a net cash level of RMB4,739 million six months ago. In addition, net notes receivable (bank notes receivable – bank notes payable) at the end of June 2015 amounted to RMB6,467 million, which could provide the Group with additional cash reserves when needed through discounting the notes with the banks. The Group sold a total of 251,873 units of vehicles in the first half of 2015, up 34.5% YoY, thanks to the good market response to the Group’s new models like “New Emgrand”, “New Vision” and “Geely GC9”. The decent volume growth was despite the sluggish automobile market in China and the slump in export sales during the period, but helped by low base for comparison during the same period in 2014. The Group’s domestic sales volume in the first half of 2015 surged 53.1% YoY to 233,990 units, much stronger than the overall passenger vehicle market in China, which was up 4.8% during the period, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The Group’s market share in China’s overall passenger vehicle market increased to around 2.5% in the first half of 2015, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Export sales volume was down 48.1% to 17,883 units in the first half of 2015, mainly affected by the challenging economic and market environment in the Group’s major export markets like Ukraine, Russia and Egypt. Export sales accounted for 7.1% of the Group’s total sales volume in the first half of 2015, compared with 18.4% in the same period in 2014.

The Group owns, manages and operates the largest integrated entertainment hotel complex in Cambodia and the only casino in Phnom Penh, the capital city. It holds a casino licence (the “Casino Licence”) granted to the Group by the Royal Government of Cambodia (the “Cambodian Government”), for a duration of 70 years commencing from 2 January 1995, and 41 years of exclusivity within a 200-km radius of Phnom Penh, Cambodia (except the Cambodia- Vietnam border area, Bokor, Kirirom Mountains and Sihanoukville). The Company completed an initial public offering of its shares (the “IPO”) and became a public company listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 19 October 2006.

This compared to approximately US$21.1 million for the same period in 2010. The Company’s signiﬁ cant net proﬁ t achievement was partnered with a gross proﬁ t increase of 59% to approximately US$79.9 million for the ﬁ rst six months ended 30 June 2011, from US$50.3 million for the same period in 2010. The Company’s gross proﬁ t margins were 71.5% for the ﬁ rst six months of 2011, and 74.2% for the ﬁ rst six months of 2010. Revenue increased by 65% to approximately US$111.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, from approximately US$67.8 million for the same period in 2010. Proﬁ ts before taxation increased by 106% to approximately US$47.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, from approximately US$23.2 million for the same period in 2010. Worldwide tourist travel grew by 4.5% in the ﬁ rst four months of 2011 compared to 2010 (Source: World Tourism Organization). Tourism in Cambodia increased by 13% to 1.4 million visitors during the ﬁ rst six months of 2011 compared to the corresponding period in 2010. Visitors from Vietnam are taking increased advantage of visa-free entry into Cambodia – 33% more Vietnamese visited the country between January and May this year than during the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve months of 2010 (Source: Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia). However, annual tourist arrivals from South East Vietnam (which includes Ho Chi Minh City) into Cambodia only represents 4% of the population of that region of the country (Source: 2009 General Statistics Ofﬁ ce of Vietnam). With a population of 14 million, and close proximity to Phnom Penh, South East Vietnam may be the Company’s customer base. Recovery in global travel during 2010 helped increase tourist arrivals into Cambodia by about 16% to 2.5 million, and increased tourism-generated revenue by 14.5% to US$1.8 billion. The sharpest gains in arrivals during 2010 were from Asia, including Vietnam (up 48% to 467,000), Korea (up 47% to 290,000), and China (up 39% to 178,000) (Source: Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia). Overall, tourism arrivals into Cambodia is expected to grow 140% over the next 10 years, from 2.5 million in 2010 to 6 million by 2020 (Source: Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia) NagaWorld has been beneﬁ ting from sustained tourism arrivals in Cambodia, with a clear trend of more visitation to public ﬂ oors and gaming machines, which yields a high margins gaming business. The Company’s revenue from junket ﬂ oor tables has also seen gains, alongside its conservative credit policy, with increased numbers of junket players and overall higher check-in amounts. With multiple food and beverage outlets, entertainment events, high quality hotel rooms, and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (“MICE”) facilities, the Company’s growing non-gaming business provides NagaWorld customers with world class variety and choice. During the ﬁ rst half of this year NagaWorld co- marketed and hosted several promotional events. These efforts, along with expanding and constantly improving the Company’s food and beverage outlets, helped NagaWorld secure the “Best Entertainment & Hospitality Services in Cambodia” award presented at the ASEAN Tourism Forum 2011 (ATF). Consecutively, ATF also named NagaWorld the “Best Business & MICE Services in Cambodia”. These two prestigious awards afﬁ rm the Company’s continued stature as the foremost destination in Indochina, for both business professionals and leisure travellers. Awards and recognition such as this attest to the Company’s effective marketing efforts, resulting in an increase of non-gaming revenue from US$4.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2010 to US$9.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011. Revenue from public ﬂ oor tables increased by 48% from US$18.8 million for the six months ended ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 16 30 June 2010 to US$27.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, as a result of higher buy-ins and an increased win rate. Buy-ins on the public ﬂ oor increased from US$88.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2010 to US$116.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, while win rates improved from 21% for the six months ended 30 June 2010 to 24% for the six months ended 30 June 2011. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, there was an average of 66 public gaming tables in operation daily. The average revenue per table per day was approximately US$2,336 for the period under review and approximately US$1,760 for the same period in 2010. This notable revenue growth from the Company’s public ﬂ oor gaming tables is a clear indicator that its business strategy of emphasizing the mass gaming market to build a strong business base is the right direction in the evolution of developing the correct gaming strategy. Key factors contributing to the increase in revenue were tighter supervision of the Company’s table operations, increased efﬁ ciency and speed of the games, emphasis on a games mix that addresses demand and proﬁ tability, and better management of table limits. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, total revenue for the gaming machines increased to US$38.8 million, representing an increase of 60% over revenue of US$24.3 million for the same period in 2010. As at 30 June 2011, the total number of slot stations was 1,035, compared with 846 as at 30 June 2010. An improving regulatory environment and the sustained political stability which has further ensured the Company’s monopoly position in the country played a signiﬁ cant part in the growth of this part of the business. With the sole casino in the city, growth of the gaming machines business can simply be achieved by placing the most correct, up-to-date gaming machines to satisfy customers’ tastes and experiences. Visibly recognizable growth was also reﬂ ected in the increase in bills-in from US$246.4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2010 to US$379.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, with an average winning per unit per day of approximately US$236 for the period under review and approximately US$214 for the same period in 2010. Win rates for the Company’s gaming machines remained consistent at 12% for both the six months ended 30 June 2010 and the six months ended 30 June 2011. Also notable is that the Company’s average revenue share on its slot machines was 69% for the period ended 30 June 2011, compared to 51% for the same period in 2010. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, revenue from the Company’s junket business was US$35.7 million, compared to US$20.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2010. Revenue from junket ﬂ oor tables accounted for 32% of the Company’s total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2011, compared to 30% for the same period in 2010. This growth is attributed to a pursuit of a conservative gaming policy aimed at earning stable revenue without gaming volatility. There is deﬁ nitely visible improvement in the Company’s junket business, which represents almost one third of total Gross Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2011. The Company is pleased to see its junket business gaining momentum, despite its policies (implemented in 2009) of tight credit and wagering on cash terms. The level of gaming activity conducted at junket ﬂ oor tables, as measured by rollings, increased by 72% to approximately US$1.6 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2011 from approximately US$0.9 billion for the same period in 2010. Check-in amounts deposited by NagaWorld’s junket players increased by 89% to approximately US$355.6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, from approximately US$188.1 million for the same period in 2010. There were approximately 7,009 junket players who visited the Company’s casino for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to 3,008 junket players for same period in 2010. The increases in overall check-in ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 17 amounts and number of players clearly validates that the Company’s strict credit policy is not a deterrent to players’ comfort level playing with cash. The win rate of NagaWorld’s junket business increased from 2.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2010 to 2.3% for the same period in 2011. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, there was an average of 65 gaming tables in operation daily. The average revenue per table per day was approximately US$3,034 for the period under review and approximately US$1,744 for the same period in 2010. Non-Gaming Revenue - Hotel, Food & Beverage and Entertainment The company saw an increase of 114% in non-gaming revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2011. With a total of 12 food and beverage outlets, the Company provides multiple choices of cuisine, including its Chinese ﬁ ne-dining outlet Fortune Palace, Korean Grill, Le Gourmet French restaurant, and Italian restaurant Bistro Romano. Each of these restaurants offers a sophisticated dining experience. For the convenience of gamers, Nagaworld’s renovated Grand Casino Restaurant is the most popular of its food and beverage outlets. The public ﬂ oor area on the ground ﬂ oor of the NagaWorld complex is very busy. To ease the ground ﬂ oor trafﬁ c, and as an extension of public ﬂ oor space, a new Life Style Casino called Naga Rock Café will soon be added to NagaWorld’s gaming space. Along with a wide variety of menu items and beverages, the outlet will offer poker and other public ﬂ oor games, as well as an additional 300 slot machines for the enjoyment of the Company’s customers. To encourage the visitation of Cambodians without foreign passports, NagaWorld has recently opened an entrance on the road leading to the neighbouring Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. NagaWorld is widely recognised as a popular entertainment and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (“MICE”) destination in Indochina, well patronized by both the public and private sectors. The present MICE rooms (already the biggest in the city of Phnom Penh) are gradually lacking space. The Company is currently constructing an additional block called the Pool Block, featuring a rooftop swimming pool, discotheque, additional 220 rooms, more gaming space and car park facilities. Also under construction is the renovation of additional 6 star suites with attached individual private gaming space – in the South Hotel Tower, for the enjoyment of junket players who seek privacy. For the six months ended 30 June 2011, the Company derived revenue of US$9.4 million from hotel and entertainment operations, representing an increase of 114% from revenue of US$4.4 million for the same period in 2010. Throughout the ﬁ rst half of 2011, NagaWorld’s average room occupancy rate was 75.2%, compared to 42.4% for 30 June 2010. As the Company’s occupancy rates continue to rise, it expects to see the results ﬂ ow through to the mass market segment of the business. This increase in non-gaming revenue was the result of the Company’s strategic marketing efforts in key target markets and reﬂ ects providing these services to both gaming and non-gaming patrons. Gross proﬁ t margins were 71.5% and 74.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010 respectively. The drop in gross proﬁ t margin was a result of a slight change in NagaWorld’s business mix wherein for the six months ended 30 June 2011, revenue derived from non-junket business contributed 68% of total revenue compared to 70% for the same period in 2010. These business segments do not incur rolling commissions, compared to the junket business where commissions are paid based on rollings achieved by junket players. ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 18 Administrative and Other Operating Expenses Administrative and other operating expenses increased by 20% to approximately US$32.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, from approximately US$27.5 million for the same period in 2010. The change was due to an increase in fuel consumption for the operation of various gaming, hotel space and additional food and beverage outlets opened in the third quarter of 2009; additional staff costs; and promotional events hosted by NagaWorld. The Company did not incur ﬁ nance costs as there were no ﬁ nancing arrangements for the six months ended 30 June 2011. Proﬁ t attributable to owners of the Company or net proﬁ t increased by 118% to approximately US$45.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011, from approximately US$21.1 million for the same period in 2010. For the six months ended 30 June 2011 net proﬁ t margins improved to 41.1% from 31.1% during the same period of 2010. This also means that the Company has more efﬁ ciency in its business, which is achieved through: 1. Pursuit of a conservative gaming policy, while generating steadily increasing gaming income, eg., monitoring junket ﬂ oor table limits. 2. Devising an ever-improving gaming strategy, eg., the public ﬂ oor’s current emphasis on high-yield mass market (slots and public ﬂ oor) toward building a strong base. 3. Operational efﬁ ciency, eg., NagaWorld hotel casino complex has continuous improving facilities, leading to more footfall and optimum mass market ﬁ gures, higher non-gaming revenue, along with very strict cost control and monitoring. Earnings per share were approximately US cents 2.21 (HK cents 17.24 per share) and US cents 1.01 (HK cents 7.88 per share) for the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 2010 respectively. As at 30 June 2011 the Group had not pledged any assets for bank borrowings (31 December 2010: Nil). As at 30 June 2011, the Group had no contingent liabilities. The Company entered into a conditional Share Purchase Agreement on 13 June 2011 with Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong to acquire TSC Inc. and TanSriChen (Citywalk) Inc. (“City Walk Inc.”) The agreed consideration for the transaction is US$369,000,000, divided as to US$275,000,000 for TSC Inc. and US$94,000,000 for City Walk Inc. The consideration will be settled, at the option of Dr Chen, in the form of consideration shares (being new ordinary shares of the Company), to be allotted and issued at a price of HK$1.8376 per consideration share; or in the form of convertible bonds issued by the Company and convertible at the option of the bondholder into conversion shares (being new ordinary shares in the Company), also to be allotted and issued at a conversion price of HK$1.8376 per conversion share; or through a combination of consideration shares and convertible bonds, to an aggregate value of US$369,000,000. The total number of new ordinary shares of the Company that stand to be allotted and issued as consideration shares or on exercise of the convertible bonds is 1,566,282,107 shares. The Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company to approve the transaction will be held on a date to be announced. ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 19 Please refer to the Company’s announcements dated 13 June 2011 and 22 June 2011 for details to the transaction. The Group’s income is principally earned in United States dollars. Expenditures are principally paid in United States dollars and to a lesser extent in Cambodian Riels. The Group does not have a signiﬁ cant exposure to foreign currency risk and therefore is not required to enter into currency hedging transactions. There were no share issues during the period under review. As at 30 June 2011, the Group had total cash and cash equivalents of approximately US$82.0 million (31 December 2010: approximately US$44.0 million). As at 30 June 2011, the Group had net current assets of approximately US$84.9 million (31 December 2010: approximately US$61.4 million). As at 30 June 2011, the Group had no outstanding borrowings (31 December 2010: US$ Nil). As at 30 June 2011, the capital and reserves attributable to owners of the Company was approximately US$338.5 million (31 December 2010: approximately US$308.7 million). For six months ended 30 June 2011, the Group employed, on average, a work force of 3,345 (For six months ended 30 June 2010: 3,233) stationed mostly in Cambodia, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Remuneration and staff costs for the six months ended 30 June 2011 was approximately US$10.9 million (for the six months ended 30 June 2010: approximately US$8.7 million). Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave, contributions to deﬁ ned contribution retirement scheme and the cost to the Group of non-monetary beneﬁ ts are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where payment or settlement is deferred and the effect would be material, these amounts are stated at their present values. NagaWorld is committed to delivering excellence in services and products to its gaming customers and good relationships with its junket operators are crucial toward satisfying this objective. The Company has maintained a win-win cordial commercial relationship with many of these junket operators for a long period of time, spanning many ups and downs in economic cycles. Mutual support is essential, as the Company’s junket business continues to make an important contribution to its business. However, the Company continues to closely monitor and review the performance of its operators. The Company has closely monitored the changes in trade receivables and focused on their recovery, resulting in a 14% decrease in trade receivables from US$34.7 million to US$29.8 million. The Company feels this is a manageable level of receivables and is pleased with the downward trend going forward. Management has credit guidelines and supervision in place for monitoring the Company’s junket operators, and depending on the performance and other criteria as set by the Company from time to time, some unqualiﬁ ed operators are not granted a credit facility. By doing so, the Company believe that this revised credit policy will be beneﬁ cial to the control and management of trade receivables in the future. For the period under review, no provision for doubtful debts was made by the Group (31 December 2010; US$7.2 million). ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 20 NagaWorld today is a popular tourist destination. The Company’s hotel and casino complex appeals to guests from a wide variety of backgrounds, cultures and interests – guests not only from the Asia Paciﬁ c region, but worldwide. NagaWorld’s facilities operate at an international standard and the Company is proud to continually receive praise and accolades from global media, investors and repeat guests. NagaWorld’s built-up area of approximately 110,768 square meters provides both scope and variety. A new lounge and club targeted toward sophisticated high-end local clientele has just been completed, helping to ensure NagaWorld’s competitive position on Indochina’s fast-growing entertainment scene. Also, with the completion of a third wing later this year, it will house, among others, a rooftop swimming pool, health club, discotheque, ofﬁ ces, an additional 220 hotel rooms, more gaming space, an additional multi- purpose hall able to accommodate 1,000 people, and additional car parking. These incremental hotel rooms will be positioned at a lower price point to appeal to a wider segment of the Company’s casino guests. The Company is also currently constructing additional 6-star suites, each with private gaming space, in its South Hotel Tower for its high-end junket guests. All of the Company’s development efforts are aimed at strengthening NagaWorld’s position as the gaming and entertainment hub of Indochina. However, this leadership position also means increasing popularity, and a strain on the Company’s current facilities. Occupancy rates remain high and NagaWorld’s public ﬂ oor tables and gaming machines see consistent high levels of activity. The additional third wing and its rooms and other facilities will help alleviate an immediate need for space, however, strengthening the Company’s long term competitive edge and maintaining its momentum require strategic vision in addressing this critical issue. During the period under review, the Company achieved a record-breaking 118% increase in net proﬁ t compared to the same period last year. The Company achieved these results by controlling costs and staying focused on an efﬁ cient business mix, which has produced higher net proﬁ t margins and lower earnings volatility for the Company. The Company believes that its integrated marketing strategy for Vietnam, and eventually for Thailand and other markets in the region will continue to generate growth from all segments of its business. The Company will continue to pursue market opportunities as they emerge. NagaCorp’s junket business continues to be an important component of the Company’s business model. With its conservative credit policy and relatively low table limit ﬁ rmly in place, the Company is pleased to see its junket business making good progress. The positive growth in this segment of the business occurred in conjunction with credit policies that grant limited credit lines to certain junket operators under strict guidelines and supervision, as well as efforts to encourage wagering on cash terms. As the Company continues to push forward with its strategy of maintaining a conservative gaming policy aimed at regional mid-size junket players, and fostering relationships with reputable operators, the Company believes that it has only just begun to tap into the junket market, especially within the burgeoning economies of Vietnam, China and Thailand. For the 6 months ended 30 June 2011 the junket business from Vietnam accounts for only 12% of headcount but 47% of rollings. Customers from China account for 13% of junket rollings while modest junket numbers from Thailand continue to improve. NagaCorp believes that moving away from low-end junkets and furthering its penetration into these critical junket markets where the potential is sizeable, is key to the future growth of this part of the business. ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 21 As NagaCorp reports its most proﬁ table interim results in the history of the Company, it is optimistic about the future. The Company believes that being centrally located in the gaming culture of Asia will continue to offer scope and unique market opportunities. For example, with a combined population of almost 160 million and rapidly growing economies, Cambodia’s neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam present prime opportunities for NagaCorp’s mass market segment of the business. On a macro-economic level, Cambodia’s key economic indicators are steadily keeping pace with its regional neighbours. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Cambodia increased by 25% during 2009- 2010 (Source: International Monetary Fund). China, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan accounted for 78% of investments into Cambodia during this period. (Source: World Bank). These investments go toward constructing and developing critical infrastructure projects, such as the Neak Loeung Bridge. Being built with a grant from Japan at an expected cost of about US$95 million, the bridge is scheduled for completion in March 2015. It will eventually replace the current ferry service across the Mekong River between Vietnam and Cambodia and reduce the travel time between the two countries by about 1 hour from the present 5½ hours (Source: Agence Kampuchea Presse; Cambodia New Vision). During 1998-2007, Cambodia’s GDP growth was strong – averaging 9.1% per year. This period of impressive growth was interrupted in 2008-2009, but is recovering strongly and forecast to grow between 6.5-6.8% annually from 2011 to 2015 (Source: Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia, International Monetary Fund). Gross National Income (GNI) per capita during 2010 increased 17% over 2009 (Source: World Bank). Cumulatively, GNI increased by 46% during 2006-2010. This strong economic growth is tightly woven into the country’s stable political environment. Tourist arrivals to Cambodia during the ﬁ rst half of the year represented an increase of 13% to 1.4 million (Source: Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia). The majority of these visitors who come to Phnom Penh also visit NagaWorld, making the company’s hotel and entertainment complex one of the most visited sites in the Kingdom of Cambodia. This increased trafﬁ c translates into greater volume at NagaWorld, driving higher gaming revenue. During the past ﬁ ve years, the Company’s performance has been on an upward trend and produced impressive results. NagaWorld performance continues to keep pace with robust levels of intra-regional travel and consumer spending, which is stimulating growth in gaming revenue. The Company has remained comparatively in line with regional competitors on a revenue basis, and has performed as a beacon in terms of net proﬁ t and return on investment. However, during the next 3-5 years, NagaWorld’s growth trajectory is expected to put signiﬁ cant strain on the Company’s capacity. Operational issues such as hotel room demand, public ﬂ oor congestion, and public car parking all need to be addressed. The Company’s corporate vision is to become an internationally competitive, world class corporation with sustained excellence in all that it does. To get there, the Company must act on its vision and maintain its long term growth strategy – acting in a timely manner and seizing the moment. Since the Company’s early beginnings in 1995 on a barge located on the Mekong River, the NagaCorp story has revolved around growth. Never remaining stagnant is the Company’s mantra and driving force. With that in mind, the Company explored the best possible course of action to address this issue of growth and the need for expansion. On 13 June 2011 NagaCorp announced a very substantial acquisition and connected transaction with NagaCorp Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and majority shareholder, Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong that will lead to major growth of the Company’s footprint in Cambodia. Within a 5 year period, three projects, namely the TSCLK Complex, NagaCity Walk and Tourist Garden will be developed, which will then be acquired by NagaCorp upon completion. ZNAGCHD11062WG_InterimReport_E_13_single.indd 22 These projects cost US$369 million and will be developed by Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong via TSC Inc., who will bear all development, ﬁ nancing and cost inﬂ ation risk. NagaCorp will have no commitments or obligations until the completion of the projects. Upon completion, NagaCorp will acquire TSC Inc. from Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong in exchange for shares/convertible bonds. The Company is optimistic about future opportunities that lie ahead. In conjunction with this optimism, NagaCorp must be competitive internationally as it aims toward a robust, sustained customer pool in the Indochina region. The Company’s vision is to become a regional powerhouse. To do this, NagaCorp will stay focused on this strategic roadmap: 1. Cambodia: Realization of certain critical mass and securing further stability in the Company’s home market, already its biggest market. 2. Expansion to Vietnam (population of 91 million and GDP of US$104 billion): a. Developing a marketing roadmap with reputable advertising/marketing ﬁ rms b. Creating a ‘superhighway’ in the sky and on the road – creating more direct transportation options for guests – particularly in Ho Chi 3. Thailand Initiatives (population of 67 million and GDP of US$319 billion): NagaWorld is intent on enhancing its position as Indochina’s premier hotel casino complex, offering international standard services and products to its customers and visitors coming from surrounding and growing economies, and beyond. The Company is intent on becoming more competitive throughout the region and internationally, both in terms of scale, and the range of facilities it offers. That means excellence on an international level in everything NagaWorld brings to its customers: rooms, MICE facilities, restaurants, entertainment and gaming facilities. The success of the Company’s gaming and entertainment business will, in turn, continue to beneﬁ t Cambodia as a host nation and continue generating return for the company, its shareholders and investors. The Board has resolved to declare payment of an interim dividend of US cents 1.54 per share (or equivalent to HK cents 12.01 per share) for the six months ended 30 June 2011 to shareholders of the Company. This represents a dividend pay- out ratio of approximately 70%, based on the net proﬁ t generated for the period. The Company will make further announcement in respect of the book closure period and the payment of interim dividend in accordance with the requirements under the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange (“Listing Rules”).

Changyou Alliance Group Limited (the “Company” or “Changyou”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) have capitalised on their years of experience in the e-commerce business, which has enabled the Group to grasp market opportunities and enter the digital points business segment and industry. In the second half of 2017, the Group formed the Changyou digital point business ecosystem alliance (the “Changyou Alliance”) with CCB International (Holdings) Limited, China UnionPay Merchant Services Company Limited, Bank of China Group Investment Limited, China Mobile (Hong Kong) Group Limited and China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited. With an aim to integrate the digital membership points, resources and strategic advantages of the business partners in the Changyou Alliance, the Group has developed an electronic platform, “Changyou” (the “Changyou Platform”). The Group strives to develop the Changyou Platform as an integrative and secured platform, so as to preserve and maximise the value of digital points as virtual assets for the platform users. With the development of blockchain technology, digital assets have received increasing attention from the industry. By leveraging advanced technologies such as blockchain and big data, the Changyou Alliance aims to develop a global financial platform for the issuance, circulation, storage and payment settlement of blockchain tokenisation of assets.

For the six months ended 30 June 2021 (the “Reporting Period”), the Changyou Alliance business’s total transaction volume and revenue amounted to approximately RMB60.1 million and approximately RMB38.85 million, respectively. Driven by advanced technologies such as big data, blockchain, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, financial technology is developing rapidly, digitalisation of financial institutions is accelerating, and digital financial products and tools are becoming increasingly abundant. In order to create a commercial financial platform catered for the future, Changyou continues to strengthen its efforts in issuance, exchange and settlement of digital points. Users can monetise Changyou points via Changyou Pay ( ) on the Changyou platform. Meanwhile, Changyou also enhances the standardised, low-cost and efficient Changyou points services for small and medium-sized enterprises with digital points. The Group offers points consumption services and points cashier output services to the Changyou Alliance and other alliances utilising the Digital Points Business. In the first half of the year, the Changyou Platform integrated channel marketing resources to further supplement China Mobile channel traffic and achieve cross-selling, actively extended the breadth of points sources to receive new loyalty program points from various enterprises, and introduced more diversified digital points forms such as red packet and membership benefits. In addition, the Changyou Platform also attracted a significant number of application ecological resources, consolidated the foundation of digital assets application, and promoted the circulation of digital assets.

In terms of catering, the Group adjusted its development plan from focusing on key urban business districts to key catering brands, and chose a fast food restaurant chain as a pilot scheme in Nanjing and Shanghai for initial testing and implementation. At the same time, the Group also continued to communicate with more restaurant chain brands. The two joint operation models of financial institution member agency operation and product commercialisation model have achieved good results. Financial institutions carried out marketing activities by relying on their own needs and combining with the resources of the Changyou Platform. With vertical use scenario and points exchange process, merchant users can get real benefits while acquiring users of other partners to achieve incremental benefits between merchants and financial institutions, so that the overall operational efficiency of the alliance can be enhanced.

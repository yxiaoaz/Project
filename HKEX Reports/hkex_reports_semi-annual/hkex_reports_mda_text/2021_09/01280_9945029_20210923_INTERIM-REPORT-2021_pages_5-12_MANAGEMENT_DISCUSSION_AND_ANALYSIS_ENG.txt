2021 is a year when People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”)’s economy continues to recover and moves toward normal levels, the first year of the “14th Five-Year Plan” and a year when the Two Centenary Goals meet and the strategies shift. In the first half of this year, with the increase in vaccination rate and the lifting of pandemic restrictions, China’s economic operation remained active, continuing the steady recovery trend since the second quarter of last year. The macroeconomic operation was stable and improving, with production demand continuing to expand, employment and commodity prices being basically stable, the micro-foundation improving significantly and market expectations continuing to improve. During the reporting period, in the context of a stable and improving macroeconomy in China, Qidian International Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”), as a home appliance retail enterprise, saw a gradual recovery in the customer traffic flow of the stores which it operated. In addition, the Group continued its efforts in optimizing its horizontal alliances initiative, aftersales and logistics support, corporate culture, information system, digitization and internal control system. As such, the Group made progress in the following aspects: During the reporting period, the Group took full advantage of the rich experience of Anhui Four Seas Huiyin Household Appliances Sales Co., Ltd (“Anhui Four Seas”), a holding subsidiary of the Group, in home appliance operation, its marketing capabilities and management experience. With many years of in-depth experience in the home appliance industry, the management team promoted the refined management of stores and led the teams to achieve established sales goals. Integration and effective utilization of recourses achieved notable results and the “1+1>2” synergistic effect gradually came into play. In January 2021, 12 departments including the Ministry of Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a Notice on Several Measures to Boost Bulk Consumption with Key Consumption and Promote the Release of Rural Consumption Potential ( ), which proposes to promote the consumption of home appliances, furniture and decoration, activate the home appliance and furniture market, and encourages qualified areas to subsidize the replacement of old home appliances and furniture with green smart home appliances and environmental-friendly furniture. The policy of the new round of “Home Appliances Going to the Countryside” ( ) is expected to drive a boom in home appliance sales arising from the demand of rural households for upgraded home appliances, and increase the rural penetration rate of home appliances such as air conditioners and smoke exhaust ventilators. At the same time, home appliances continue to be upgraded and iterated driven by technology progress, and continue to evolve toward a smart, environmentally friendly and energy-saving trend, and the demand for upgraded home appliances has gradually become prominent. Since the Group has been working on the exploration of the home appliance retail markets in the third- and fourth-tier cities for many years, it keeps abreast of the relevant macro policies and home appliance industry policies, fully studies the policy of the new round of “Home Appliances Going to the Countryside”, keenly captures the opportunities of incremental demand arising from the policy on the rural market and continues to explore the rural incremental market. Through implementing different marketing strategies for white household appliances (refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners) which have entered the replacement and upgrading cycle and other types of home appliances, the Group made steady progress in respect of its existing market share while effectively developing prospects for growth. On the policy front, as a result of China’s efforts to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in economic development, high-quality consumption has been comprehensively promoted. On the demand front, there are approximately 180 million new middle-class consumers in China, and the number of middle-class families reached approximately 33.20 million.

Under various favorable policies, potential customers are being gradually guided to mid-to-high-end home appliances. In such context, during the reporting period, the Group focused on selecting healthy and smart home appliances, and placed particular emphasis on the integration and systematic construction of technical functions of home appliances, while adhering to the concept of comfortable home and promoting the sale of green and environmentally friendly home appliances. Meanwhile, the Group adjusted its product selection strategy in a timely manner.

According to National Bureau of Statistics of China, the per capita disposable income of the PRC rose from RMB23,800 to RMB32,200 from 2016 to 2020. The national disposable income per capita of the PRC grew by 2.1% in real terms, after deducting price factors. The increasing consumption level of residents has helped the upgrade in home appliance consumption. According to the Report on Home Appliance Market of China in 2020 ( 2020 ), the annual average home appliance consumption online per user increased from RMB1,469 to RMB2,218 from 2015 to 2020, reflecting the changes in consumer shopping habits and the increased spending in online home appliances. At the same time, the changes in home appliance consumer structure also affected the changes in demand for home appliances. According to the Report on Home Appliance Market of China in 2020 ( 2020 ), nearly 60% of home appliance consumers in the PRC are under the age of 35 in 2020. Under the development trend of 5G and the Internet of Things, the new generation of consumers pursue intelligence, personalization and refinement, willing to accept products with attractive appearance, new functions and high-quality, which promotes the quality upgrade of home appliance consumption in the PRC. In the future, driven by the changing demand of home appliances, the products will continue to upgrade: (1) Diversification and personalization of home appliance products with feature functions.

In addition, the Group will continue to study the trend of home appliance products updates and upgrades, launch home appliance products suitable for multiple age groups in a timely manner, and make full use of the intrinsic advantages of the home appliance industry’s iterative nature.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, online retail sales of physical goods increased rapidly as a percentage of the total retail sales of consumer goods, reaching 24.9% in 2020, up 14.1 percentage points from 2015. In respect of home appliances consumption, the proportion of online retail sales of home appliances has grown faster than that of the overall physical goods. In addition, the outbreak of the pandemic has accelerated changes in the retail channels of the home appliance industry, resulting in an accelerated online and offline integration. In 2020, due to the restrictions of the pandemic, consumers who previously relied on offline consumption gradually developed the consumption habit of online shopping, and the online and offline channels of the home appliance industry have arrived at a neck-and-neck situation. According to the Report on Home Appliance Market of China in 2020 ( 2020 ), the online retail sales of home appliances accounted for 50.4% in 2020, exceeding the offline retail sales for the first time.

According to the National Household Appliances Industry Information Center, in the first quarter of 2021, the offline channels of home appliance products continued the growth momentum of the fourth quarter of 2020, with offline retail sales reaching RMB87.27 billion, an increase of 47.4% year-on-year, whereas the online sales of home appliances was RMB76.91 billion, an increase of 32.5% year-on-year. In the context of changes in the retail channels, the Group, as a home appliance retailer in third- and fourth-tier cities, will closely follow the tide of the times. On the one hand, it will deeply study the role of online and offline new retail models in promoting the sustainable development of the home appliance industry. On the other hand, it will intensify its efforts to promote changes in retail channels, accelerate the integration of online and offline channels and give full play to the unique advantages of online and offline channels, striving to improve the performance of home appliance retail operation. In recent years, due to major changes in the economic environment such as geopolitical games and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s economic growth has faced certain downward pressure, and new digital technologies represented by industrial internet, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things have been increasingly integrated with the real economy. The Group will continue to accelerate digital-based retail in stores and establish a data processing middle platform to enable it to solve issues on information exchange and data sharing, which will lead to a more accurate and clearer category planning and more effective data analysis in marketing activities, thereby accelerating precise marketing decisions and improving the efficiency of corporate competition.

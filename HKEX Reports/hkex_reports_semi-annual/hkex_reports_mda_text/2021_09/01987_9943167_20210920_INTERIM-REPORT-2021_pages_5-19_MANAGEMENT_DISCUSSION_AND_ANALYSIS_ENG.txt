During 1H2021, the Group was continuously impacted by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic due to a surge of new outbreaks of COVID-19 cases during the second quarter of 2021 in Singapore, which triggered the Singapore Government to re-implement additional pre-emptive measures (“Measures”). The demolition activities of the Group have gradually resumed since the second half of 2020 and the Measures are not as stringent as compared to the imposition of the Circuit Breaker by the Singapore Government during 1H2020, whereby all the demolition projects of the Group were suspended or delayed. Following the recovery from the pandemic, the Group recorded a higher revenue for 1H2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. This has led to the improved financial performance of the Group from its gross loss position during 1H2020 to a gross profit position for the same period in 2021. Interim Report 2021 The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause an impact to the global economy and Singapore has not been spared. According to the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry, the performance of the Singapore economy in the first half of 2021 was stronger than expected. The COVID-19 situation has also stabilised with the vaccination programme making continued good progress. Through dampened by the major setback in the global economy, the Singapore economy is expected to continue to see a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, supported in large part by outward oriented sectors. According to the Singapore Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”), the total construction demand in 2021 is projected to recover to between S$23 billion and S$28 billion. Public sector projects are also expected to drive this year’s demand with an anticipated stronger demand for public housing, transport and healthcare infrastructure projects. Meanwhile, private sector construction demand is also expected to improve steadily in the same period. Therefore, the Directors are cautiously optimistic to the sustained recovery of construction and demolition demand in the coming year. The Group is monitoring the situation closely and will maintain operational and financial prudence amidst a challenging economy. Moreover, with the large-scale economic stimulus policies introduced by the Singaporean government and potential growth of the construction industry in Singapore, the demolition industry is expected to emerge stronger than before after the difficult transitions and significant changes brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Group intends to continue the existing principal businesses of providing demolition services in Singapore. At the same time, the Group has also expanded and diversified its business by investing into new business opportunities, which can enhance shareholder value as well as complement and leverage existing business lines. Since September 2020, the Group has devoted resources to develop new businesses related to the e-commerce business, the outlook and prospects of which the Directors are continuously optimistic about. During 1H2021, the Group’s revenue was primarily derived from undertaking demolition projects for the Group’s project owners (the “Contract Revenue”). The Contract Revenue comprises of (i) the net contract sum from the project owners; (ii) the proceeds from the disposal of salvage materials removed from the demolition sites to third party salvage materials buyers; (iii) the proceeds from earth providers for depositing earth at the demolition sites for landfilling purposes and (iv) e-commerce services. The Group’s revenue for the 1H2021 was approximately S$8.5 million, representing an increase of approximately 129.7% from approximately S$3.7 million for 1H2020 , as a result of the recovery of the construction market in Singapore which resulted in: (i) an increase in the demand for demolition services; and (ii) the increased demand for salvage materials. The following table sets forth the breakdown of the revenue by the nature of work undertaken during 1H2021 and 1H2020. Other revenue (1) Note: Other revenue mainly comprises of other service income for services rendered for site operation management. Interim Report 2021 The Group’s cost of sales mainly comprises of (i) direct labour costs incurred for the provision of the Group’s demolitions works; (ii) depreciation of the Group’s machinery and equipment; (iii) raw materials, consumables and other overheads; and (iv) subcontractor charges. The following table sets out the breakdown of the Group’s direct costs during 1H2021 and 1H2020. Raw materials, consumables and The Group’s cost of sales decreased from approximately S$9.3 million for 1H2020 to approximately S$7.9 million for 1H2021, representing a decrease of The decrease in cost of sales mainly attributable to the decrease in the engagements with subcontractors and transportation expenses. The large decrement was mainly due to varying project costs from project to project according to the different type of work performed, resulting in fluctuations in the proportions of these costs from project to project. In line with the increase in revenue, the Group’s gross profit increased by approximately S$6.2 million, from a gross loss of approximately S$5.6 million for 1H2020 to a gross profit of approximately S$0.6 million for 1H2021, representing an increase of approximately 110.7%. In line with the improved gross profit for the 1H2021, the Group recorded a gross profit margin of approximately 7.2% for 1H2021 as compared to gross loss margin of 153.3% for 1H2020. The increase in the Group’s gross profit margin was mainly due to the combined effects of (i) resumption of demolition activities that generate sufficient revenue to offset the fixed costs; and (ii) decrease in the cost of sales as a result of cost reduction measures taken by the Group. Administrative expenses primarily consisted of (i) staff costs; and (ii) depreciation costs in respect of the Group’s property, office equipment and motor vehicles. The Group’s administrative expenses for 1H2021 amounted to approximately S$3.8 million, which remained stable compared to 1H2020. During 1H2021, the Group’s other income amounted to S$0.4 million as compared to approximately S$0.6 for 1H2020. The decrease of approximately S$0.2 million primarily resulted from the decrease in government grants received during 1H2021 for COVID-19 measures. The Group recorded finance costs of approximately S$0.1 million for 1H2021 and S$0.2 million for 1H2020, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately S$0.1 million or 50.0%. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in interest expenses on bank borrowings and lease liabilities. Interim Report 2021 During 1H2021, the Group did not incur any income tax expenses or income tax credit as compared to 1H2020 since the Group recorded a loss before income tax in 1H2021.

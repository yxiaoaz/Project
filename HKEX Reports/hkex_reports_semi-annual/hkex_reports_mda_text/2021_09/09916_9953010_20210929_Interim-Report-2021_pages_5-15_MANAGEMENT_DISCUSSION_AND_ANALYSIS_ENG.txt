During the Period, we entered into 26 property engineering contracts with an aggregated original contract sum, net of tax, of approximately RMB46.4 million (30 June 2020: RMB22.6 million). The increase in contract value were attributable to engineering services provided to property projects in larger scale, which also will bring/brought higher revenue to the Group.

During the Period, our Group’s total revenue was approximately RMB133.2 million, representing an increase of approximately 46.4% as compared to approximately RMB91.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020.

This increase was primarily as a result of the growth of our properties under management of approximately 1.0 million sq.m., as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, through (i) the expansion of property management services to cover sales offices and show flats since the fourth quarter of 2020 with revenue of approximately RMB15.1 million with full-period effect during the Period; and (ii) the newly delivered properties during the second half year of 2020 and the Period, including Zensun Binhe Mingzhu ( ), Zensun Zichen Garden ( ), Zensun Huihang Mingzhu ( ), Zensun Cheng He Yuan Court No. 2 ( 2 ), Zensun Yazhu Garden ( ), etc, which brought an increase in revenue of approximately RMB5.8 million.

The increase was primarily due to the new contracts with higher contract value entered into during the second half year of 2020 and the Period and revenue recognised for performance achieving certain progress from these contracts during the Period. Our Group’s cost of sales primarily consists of subcontracting costs, staff costs and materials and consumables. We recorded an increase in cost of sales of approximately RMB36.0 million or 79.6% from approximately RMB45.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 to approximately RMB81.1 million for the Period.

Our gross profit margin was approximately 39.2% for the Period as compared to approximately 50.4% for the six months ended 30 June 2020. The decrease in gross profit margin was as a result from change in contribution from different revenue types in respect of our overall increase in revenue mainly contributed by (i) new income stream arising from property management services to sales offices and show flats which were primarily charged with the cost mark-up basis; and (ii) property engineering services upon achieving certain progress, which generally have a lower gross profit margin as compared to our other property management and value-added services. In addition, our gross profit margin was also affected by the increase in staff and subcontracting costs, while the average property management fees remain relatively stable.

Such decrease was a result of the combined effect of (i) the reduction in listing expense of approximately RMB8.0 million in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Global Offering”) incurred during the six months ended 30 June 2020, which offsetted (ii) the increase in research and development expense of approximately RMB1.3 million during the Period mainly in respect of our property engineering services; (iii) increase in administrative staff (including senior management personnel) cost of approximately RMB1.2 million; and (iv) increase in other general administrative maintenance expense (e.g. printing and office expenses) of approximately RMB1.5 million.

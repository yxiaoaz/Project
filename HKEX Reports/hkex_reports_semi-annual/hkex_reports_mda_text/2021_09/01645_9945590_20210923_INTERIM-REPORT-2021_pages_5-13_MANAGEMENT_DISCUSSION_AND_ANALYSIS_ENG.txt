This was mainly due to the decrease in the sales of medical disposable face mask machines by approximately RMB144.7 million. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in sales of baby diaper machines (approximately RMB59.4 million), adult diaper machines (approximately RMB50.6 million), lady sanitary napkin machines (approximately RMB22.1 million), underpad machines (approximately RMB3.5 million), and components and parts (approximately RMB2.5 million). The decrease in sales of medical disposable face mask machines was mainly due to a decrease in demand of medical disposable face mask machines and no medical disposable face mask machines sold by the Group for the Period as compared with 201 units of medical disposable face mask machines sold for the Prior Period, which was primarily attributable to a return of normalcy in the PRC after the effects of the coronavirus disease subsided. As at 30 June 2021, the Group has entered into sales contracts with its customers for the sales and purchase of 38, 17, 12 and 1 units of baby diaper machines, adult diaper machines, lady sanitary napkin machines and underpad machines with aggregate contract values of approximately RMB239.5 million, RMB164.7 million, RMB43.9 million and RMB2.2 million, respectively.

The machines under these contracts are expected to be delivered during the second half of 2021 or the first half of 2022. 00E2108023 IR.indb 7 00E2108023 IR.indb 7 The gross profit for the Period decreased by approximately RMB33.0 million as compared to the Prior Period of approximately RMB78.8 million. The gross profit margin decreased by approximately 15.1% to approximately 22.8% for the Period (Prior Period: approximately 37.9%). The decreases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to no medical disposable face mask machines sold by the Group for the Period, which commanded a higher gross profit margin. The other income mainly comprised government grants, bank interest income, bond interest income and income from the sale of scrap materials. The government grants mainly represented the government grants received from government authorities of Fujian Province such as Jinjiang Finance Bureau, Jinjiang Bureau of Economy and Information Technology and Quanzhou Municipal People’s Government, the entitlements of which were unconditional and at the discretion of the relevant authorities. All the government grants received during the Period and/or the Prior Period were one-off and unconditional.

The selling and distribution costs slightly increased by approximately RMB0.1 million or 2.3%, from approximately RMB5.5 million for the Prior Period to approximately RMB5.6 million for the Period. The increase in selling and distribution costs was mainly due to the Group participated in the sanitary paper industry exhibition in the PRC in early 2021 for promotion of its products. The administrative and other operating expenses mainly comprised research and development expenses, staff costs, depreciation, amortisation and donation. The administrative and other operating expenses increased from approximately RMB20.6 million for the Prior Period by approximately RMB7.7 million or 37.4% to approximately RMB28.3 million for the Period. The increase in administrative and other operating expenses was mainly due to increase in research and development expenses by approximately RMB5.4 million, professional fees by approximately RMB2.2 million which related to acquisition of Hangzhou Haina, grant of share options and employment of placing agent, and increase in staff costs by approximately RMB2.3 million. Such increase was offset by a decrease in donation to charitable organisations, from approximately RMB2.4 million for the Prior Period by approximately RMB1.4 million to approximately RMB1.0 million for the Period. For the Period, finance costs was approximately RMB0.6 million, which decreased by approximately 6.0% as compared with the Prior Period (approximately RMB0.7 million). The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in finance charges on lease liabilities for right-of-use assets in respect of the Group’s leased properties. For the Period, income tax expenses were approximately RMB2.2 million, which decreased by approximately 76.1% as compared with the Prior Period (approximately RMB9.2 million). The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in profits of the Group’s operating subsidiaries in the PRC for the Period and also no withholding tax on declaration of dividend from its subsidiaries in the PRC for the Period. 00E2108023 IR.indb 8 00E2108023 IR.indb 8 For the Period, the Company’s profit attributable to owners of the Company were approximately RMB18.3 million (Prior Period: approximately RMB24.6 million).

Our vision is to become globally recognized as a leading Chinese biopharmaceutical company by bringing innovative and differentiated oncology therapies to cancer patients worldwide. Founded in 2015, we are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative immuno-oncology and molecularly targeted drugs to address significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment. The Company has built an oncology-focused pipeline of 15 drug candidates with a strategic emphasis on IO combination therapies, including our three IO backbone drug candidates (PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 antibodies) at clinical stage. As of the date of this report, five late-stage candidates are in pivotal trials. We believe that our pipeline has both the scale and mix to enable a winning combination therapy strategy and allows us to develop one of the largest oncology combination therapy portfolios among all China-based biopharmaceutical companies. For details of any of the foregoing, please refer to the rest of this report and, where applicable, the Prospectus of the Company and prior announcements published on the websites of the Stock Exchange and the Company. Our core product candidate, sugemalimab, is a fully human, full-length anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. sugemalimab mirrors natural G-type immune globulin 4 (“IgG4”) human antibody, which can reduce the risk of immunogenicity and potential toxicities in patients, potentially representing a unique advantage over similar drugs. To complement our IO backbone drug candidates, we obtained exclusive licenses from Agios for ivosidenib (CS3010) and Blueprint Medicines for avapritinib (CS3007), pralsetinib (CS3009), and fisogatinib (CS3008) to develop and commercialize the four molecularly targeted compounds in Greater China. All four compounds have achieved proof-of-concept for their lead indications based on clinical data from the respective global trials. The U.S. FDA approved ivosidenib in July 2018 as the first treatment of IDH1m R/R AML in its class globally. avapritinib is also the first drug candidate in its class globally for the treatment targeting PDGFRA D842V mutations and the U.S. FDA approved avapritinib for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations in January 2020. pralsetinib (CS3009) and fisogatinib (CS3008) each has the potential to be a first-in-class precision therapy option globally. interim rePort 2020 Lead Indication(s) and Line(s) of PDGFRA exon 18 Solid tumors, (A2aR) Note: Assets status denote progress in the region noted in the column titled “Rights”.

Our current clinical development activities mainly relate to the clinical advancement of our 12 clinical and IND stage drug candidates. As of June 30, 2020, we have initiated 30 clinical trials, including six registrational trials for our core product candidate, sugemalimab, the PD-L1 antibody, one registrational trial for CS1003, a PD-1 antibody and eight registrational/registration enabling trials for three licensed-in products, including ivosidenib, avapritinib and pralsetinib. By the end of 2020, we expect to have more than 30 ongoing and/or completed trials in China and globally. As of the date of this report, we have made significant progress with respect to our product pipeline. Sugemalimab (PD-L1 antibody) Our core product candidate, sugemalimab, is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1 that is currently being investigated in pivotal clinical trials in China. As a fully-human, full-length anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, sugemalimab mirrors natural G-type IgG4 human antibody, which may potentially reduce the risk of immunogenicity and toxicity in patients, a potential unique advantage and differentiation factor compared to similar drugs. As of June 24, 2020, we have dosed more than 1,300 patients in sugemalimab’s clinical trials. As of the date of this report, we are currently conducting five registrational trials for sugemalimab, three of which were initiated in 2018, including stage III NSCLC, stage IV NSCLC and NKTL, and the other two were initiated in 2019, including advanced gastric cancer and esophageal cancer. A phase III trial of sugemalimab in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies in patients with first-line Stage IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC. In August 2020, the Phase III trial of sugemalimab met primary endpoint as first-line treatment for Stage IV squamous and non- squamous NSCLC. We plan to submit an NDA to the NMPA in the second half of 2020. o Globally first anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody to demonstrate overwhelming efficacy as 1L treatment of Stage IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in a randomized, double-blind phase III trial. o Interim analysis showed that sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy had a statistically significant prolongation of PFS, the primary endpoint of the trial, compared with placebo combined with chemotherapy, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 50%. The median PFS was 7.8 months vs. 4.9 months in sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy and placebo combined with chemotherapy, respectively. o Subgroup analyses showed clinical benefit across histology subtypes and PD-L1 expression levels. o Sugemalimab in combination with chemotherapy was well tolerated, no new safety signals were identified. A phase III trial of sugemalimab in patients with Stage III NSCLC as monotherapy in the maintenance setting following chemoradiation. We expect top-line data readout by the end of 2020 or early 2021. A phase II registrational clinical trials of sugemalimab as monotherapy for the treatment of NKTL. We presented promising clinical data for NKTL at the annual meeting of American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) in December 2019. After consulting with the NMPA and the U.S. FDA regarding NDA/Biologics License Application (“BLA”) criteria for the indication of NKTL, we’ll continue enrolling patients and expect to submit Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) and ODD requests to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2020. We have received an IND approval for the NKTL pivotal trial from the U.S. FDA in August 2020. interim rePort 2020 A phase III trial of sugemalimab in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies for first-line treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer. A phase III trial of sugemalimab in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies for first-line treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer. To capitalize on the significant market opportunity in China, we are strategically developing multiple combination therapies of sugemalimab with candidates from our internal pipeline and external partners. Sugemalimab (PD-L1 antibody) with fisogatinib (CS3008, FGFR4 inhibitor) in HCC: Phase Ib part was completed with the RP2D declared in June 2020. The first patient was dosed in dose- expansion of the Phase II part in July 2020. Sugemalimab (PD-L1 antibody) with donafenib: Phase I/II trial to be initiated in China in 2020. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REQUIRED BY RULE 18A.08(3) OF THE LISTING RULES: WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET SUGEMALIMAB SUCCESSFULLY. CS1003 (PD-1 antibody) We have initiated a global Phase III trial of CS1003 in combination with LENVIMA® (lenvatinib), a standard-of-care TKI in patients with advanced HCC and dosed the first patient in December 2019. In July 2020, CS1003 was granted an ODD by the U.S. FDA for HCC. The first patient has been dosed in a Phase Ib trial of CS1003 in combination with regorafenib in Australia in December 2019. A scientific paper describing the full characterization of CS1003 and its pre-clinical data was published on Acta Phamacologica Sinica in May 2020 (Fu et al, 2020 online). Pralsetinib (CS3009, RET inhibitor) We obtained an exclusive license from Blueprint Medicines for the development and commercialization of pralsetinib in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in June 2018. The registrational study of pralsetinib in Chinese RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients achieved the pre- defined results. In September 2020, NMPA accepted our NDA with priority review designation for pralsetinib for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with platinum- based chemotherapy. Primary efficacy data showed deep and durable anti-tumor activity of pralsetinib in RET fusion- positive NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Pralsetinib was well-tolerated in the Chinese patient population. Overall, the data showed that efficacy and safety profile in Chinese patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC were consistent with previously reported data from the global patient population in the ARROW trial. We have also completed enrollment in China for the cohort of patients with RET mutant MTC who have not been previously treated with systemic therapy. We have initiated an additional registrational cohort for first-line RET fusion-positive NSCLC with the first subject dosed in the first quarter of 2020. We are enrolling patients in a basket trial in other tumor types. Blueprint Medicines has submitted an NDA to the U.S. FDA for advanced or metastatic RET mutant MTC and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancers in the second quarter of 2020. Blueprint Medicines announced global (excluding Greater China) collaboration with Roche to develop and commercialize pralsetinib for patients with RET-altered cancers in July 2020. In September 2020, Blueprint Medicines announced the U.S. FDA approval of pralsetinib for the treatment of adults with metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Avapritinib (CS3007, KIT/PDGFRA inhibitor) We obtained an exclusive license from Blueprint Medicines for the development and commercialization of avapritinib in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in June 2018. We have submitted an NDA to the NMPA for avapritinib for adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, which was accepted in April 2020. We were granted priority review by the NMPA in July 2020. We have submitted an NDA to TFDA for the same indication in March 2020. Data presented at 2020 ASCO by us has shown that avapritinib was generally well-tolerated and had promising preliminary anti-tumor activity in Chinese GIST patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation. Approved avapritinib for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. In April 2020, Blueprint Medicines announced top-line data from the phase III VOYAGER trial of avapritinib versus regorafenib in third- or fourth-line GIST. The VOYAGER trial did not meet its primary endpoint of an improvement in progression-free survival for avapritinib versus regorafenib. We don’t expect this result will impact the review and approval of avapritinib for unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations in China. Ivosidenib (CS3010, IDH1 inhibitor) We obtained an exclusive license from Agios for further clinical development and commercialization of ivosidenib in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in June 2018, and in Singapore in March We have received an NDA approval from TFDA for ivosidenib for adult patients with R/R AML containing IDH1m. We are conducting two registrational trials in China: one for IDH1m R/R AML, and another for newly diagnosed IDH1m AML patients who are not eligible for intensive therapy. We expect to submit an NDA for R/R AML in Singapore in the second half of 2020. interim rePort 2020 Fisogatinib (CS3008; FGFR4 inhibitor) We obtained an exclusive license from Blueprint Medicines for the development and commercialization of fisogatinib in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in June 2018. Preliminary data have indicated that fisogatinib may offer an effective treatment option for certain HCC patients. We received IND approval for fisogatinib from the NMPA to join the dose-expansion portion of a global phase I trial in patients with advanced HCC in January 2019. We dosed the first patient in May 2019 and completed enrollment in December 2019. We received CTA approval from the NMPA in May 2019 to start a phase Ib/II trial of fisogatinib in combination with sugemalimab (PD-L1 antibody) in patients with HCC. We dosed the first patient in December 2019 and completed the phase Ib part with the RP2D declared in June 2020. We have initiated the phase II part in July 2020. CS1002 (CTLA-4 antibody) We have completed the dose escalation part of a phase I trial of CS1002 as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors in Australia. We presented preliminary phase I data of CS1002 at the 2019 CSCO meeting and showed that CS1002 treatment was well-tolerated and demonstrated pharmacodynamic changes consistent with CTLA-4 inhibition. The first patient was dosed for the dose escalation part of the phase I clinical trial of CS1002 in combination with CS1003 (PD-1 antibody) for the treatment of patients with solid tumors in Australia in January 2020. The dose-expansion part was initiated with the first patient dosed in May 2020. We have received IND approval for CS1002 from the NMPA in August 2018 and the first patient was dosed in a phase I trial of CS1002 as a single agent in China in December 2019. CS3002 (CDK4/6 inhibitor) The first patient was dosed in Australia in January 2020 in a phase I trial of CS3002 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with solid tumors in Australia and China. In February 2020, we received IND approval from NMPA for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. CS3005 (A2aR antagonist) The first patient was dosed in Australia in January 2020 in a phase I trial of CS3005 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with solid tumors in Australia and China. In May 2020, we received IND approval from NMPA for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. NM21-1480 (PD-L1×4-1BB×HSA tri-specific molecule) Numab filed an IND application for NM21-1480 to the U.S. FDA in March 2020 and received “may proceed” letter in April, 2020. The IND has been approved by the U.S. FDA in June 2020. We have received an IND approval for NM21-1480 from TFDA in August 2020. We focus on the research and development of innovative immuno-oncology and molecularly targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our drug discovery and pre-clinical research team conducts drug discovery, formulation development, process development, and pre-clinical research of new drug candidates. For the six month ended June 30, 2020, we focused on the execution of our pipeline 2.0 strategy and assembled potential drug candidates through “dual sourcing” innovation – from both internal discovery research and collaboration with academic labs and innovative biotech companies, aiming to develop first- in-class molecules to target novel biology, tumor microenvironment, multi-specific biologics, and cancer vaccines. As of the date of this report, we had obtained 40 IND/CTA approvals for 12 drug candidates in 8 territories. Our research team will continue to advance the pre-clinical drug candidates in our pipeline towards IND. For instance, we are completing the preclinical studies to support IND/CTA applications of CS1009, another immune checkpoint inhibitor, and plan to submit the applications in China in 2021. In June 2020, the Company released the pre-clinical data of its three pipeline products, i.e. sugemalimab (PD-L1), CS3002 (CDK4/6) and CS3003 (HDAC6), in the E-poster presentation session at the 2020 AACR virtual annual meeting II. Our business model is designed to accelerate the development of innovative drugs. We focus on clinical development, which has long been a bottleneck in the innovative drug development value chain in China, through both adaptive clinical trial design and clinical trial operational excellence. Leveraging our strong internal research capabilities, we continue to identify and develop new drug candidates to advance to clinical stage. We will continue to advance our pre-clinical assets towards the IND stage and develop new internal assets through our in-house research capability and collaboration with top academic institutions and world-leading Contract Research Organizations. Looking into the second half of 2020 and beyond, we expect to receive the marketing approval for ivosidenib in R/R AML in Taiwan and submit NDAs for sugemalimab, pralsetinib and ivosidenib in mainland China and Singapore. With the expected NDA approvals above, and strong commercial capability founded by acquiring top talents in Greater China market, we are confident in maximizing the commercial potential of our five late-stage clinical drug candidates with worldwide or Greater China rights. interim rePort 2020 We will focus on internal salesforce build-up while exploring potential value-creative strategic partnerships both in China and globally. With clear and aspirational commercial strategy established, we will build a full- fledged commercial team, equipped with approximately 200 full time equivalent by year-end 2020, as well as robust launch plans developed for mainland China and Taiwan. With our deep understanding of the business environment in the local market, we will develop powerful and distinctive market access strategy to address the unmet medical needs in mainland China and Taiwan. Meanwhile, we will enhance public relations and digital marketing activities to establish corporate and product branding, and also further reinforce the engagement of key opinion leaders and cancer society. These will be supported by operation and commercial excellence, as well as talent acquisition and manpower development activities.

Our other income increased by RMB5.0 million from RMB23.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB28.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This was primarily attributable to more government grants received. Other Gains and Losses. Our other gains and losses increased by RMB724.1 million from losses of RMB690.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to gains of RMB34.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the elimination of losses in fair value of derivative financial liabilities as the Group had no preferred shares outstanding as of June 30, 2020. Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development expenses increased by RMB160.6 million from RMB383.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB544.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in third party contracting cost by RMB134.0 million from RMB212.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB346.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 for enrolling more patients for our clinical trials; and (ii) an increase in our licensing fee from RMB14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB35.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, due to milestone payment incurred for the existing licensing agreements and also the payment incurred for entering into new licensing agreements with third-party partners.

For the six months ended June 30, interim rePort 2020 Selling Expenses. Our selling expenses increased from nil for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB24.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in employee cost and professional fees incurred for activities associated with marketing and sales prior to product launch. For the six months ended June 30 2020 Finance Costs. The finance costs increased by RMB0.1 million from RMB0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to RMB0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Listing Expenses. We did not incur any listing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The RMB17.6 million listing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were mainly attributable to legal and professional fees in relation to the initial public offering of our Shares. Other Comprehensive Income (Expense). Our other comprehensive income (expense) changed from an expense of RMB0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to an income of RMB0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. To supplement the Group’s consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with the IFRS, the Company also uses adjusted loss for the period and other adjusted figures as additional financial measures, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, the IFRS. The Company believes that these adjusted measures provide useful information to shareholders and potential investors in understanding and evaluating the Group’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as they help the Company’s management. Adjusted loss for the period represents the loss for the period excluding the effect of certain non-cash items and onetime events, namely the loss on fair value changes of the conversion feature of preferred shares (derivative financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) and share-based compensation expenses. The term adjusted loss for the period is not defined under the IFRS. The use of this non-IFRS measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation from, or as substitute for analysis of, the Group’s results of operations or financial condition as reported under IFRS. The Company’s presentation of such adjusted figure may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. However, the Company believes that this and other non-IFRS measures are reflections of the Group’s normal operating results by eliminating potential impacts of items that the management do not consider to be indicative of the Group’s operating performance, and thus facilitate comparisons of operating performance from period to period and company to company to the extent applicable.

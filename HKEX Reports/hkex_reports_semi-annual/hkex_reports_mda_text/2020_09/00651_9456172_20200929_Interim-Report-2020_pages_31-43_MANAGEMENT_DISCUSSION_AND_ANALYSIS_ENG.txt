China Ocean Industry Group Limited is engaged in the intelligent car-parking and automotive electronics, shipbuilding, steel structure engineering and installation business, trading and finance lease business. Having affected by various unfavorable factors, the global economy has been in a new wave of uncertainty and China’s domestic economy has also been experiencing unprecedented difficulties. As an enterprise focusing on manufacturing, the impact on the Group was even more significant. Faced with the continuous downturn in the shipbuilding industry, the Group has encountered difficulties in financing with high cost of funding which were commonly faced by enterprises during the process of transformation, resulting in the standstill of some business segments of the Group. In order to find a way to overcome difficulties, the Group mainly focused on the revitalization of shipbuilding assets and the restructuring of debts during the first half of 2020. Under the guidance of the government, the Group promoted cooperation with leading corporations in order to carry out effective utilization of the Group’s lands, factories, shorelines of the Yangtze River, etc. and seek the restructuring of debts on this basis. However, due to certain uncontrollable factors, such cooperation has experienced setbacks. Meanwhile, the Company received a winding up petition from a partner in Hong Kong which also affected the Group’s new financing plan. Although surrounded by abovementioned unfavorable factors, the Group refused to give up and continued to enhance the communication with the government, financial institutional creditors with a view to introduce new partnerships and implement strategic business restructuring plans. The current business restructuring plans of the Group has received great supports from different levels of governments in Jiangxi Province and Jiangsu Province, and received positive response from financial institutions. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the Group has been achieving substantive progress in various aspects. For the six months ended 30 June 2020 (the “Period”), the Group recorded an external revenue of HK$12.18 million (2019: HK$38.78 million). During the Period under review, the Group recorded gross profit of HK$3.06 million (2019: gross loss of HK$4.02 million), while the Group recorded gross loss in last period. The Group’s finance cost decreased from HK$248.32 million to HK$102.87 million, mainly due to the decreased in interests and guarantee fee in connection with borrowings. In general, for the six months ended 30 June 2020, the Group recorded a loss attributable to owners of the Company of approximately HK$134.44 million (2019: HK$302.02 million), representing a substantial decrease, as compared to last period, which was mainly due to the significant reduction in finance costs. The shipbuilding business had not recorded external revenue (2019: HK$1.25 million) during the Period under review. In relation to the six vessels, four of them (the “Four Vessels”) which had been rescinded in 2018 are in the course of seeking buyers and relevant intentional agreements have already been reached. Meanwhile, the Group is negotiating with relevant creditor banks and financial institutions in relation to the disposal of these vessels. For the remaining two vessels (the “Two vessels”) which had been rescinded in 2019 are in the course of seeking buyers. In order to maximize the benefits to the Group, the solutions will be taken account in conjunction with the overall restructuring plan of Jiangxi Jiangzhou Union Shipbuilding Ltd. Shipbuilding business is the focus of the restructuring of the Group. The Group will gradually adjust the operation model and product structure of the shipbuilding business to reduce the losses of the shipbuilding business. In order to completely alter the constraints arising from its shipbuilding business to the Group, the Group continues to promote cooperation with relevant state-owned enterprises with a view to restructure the shipbuilding assets of Jiangzhou, Jiangxi Province. Meanwhile, the Group committed to expand the logistic, storage and shipping business leveraging on its geographical advantages and shoreline of Yangtze River, and related work is in progress. For the six months ended 30 June 2020, the intelligent car-parking and automotive electronics business recorded an external revenue of HK$9.66 million (2019: HK$15.85 million), representing a decrease of 39.05% as compared with last period. The intelligent car-parking and automotive electronics business of the Group has been greatly affected by the litigation of associates. The Group has adopted closing part of the production facilities and reducing the number of employees to scale down the business of this segment. The finance lease company is a company established in Zhoushan jointly by the Group and an investment platform company of the government. In order to improve the balance sheet, the Group may consider to quit this business segment. As disclosed in the section “Independent Auditor’s Report” (the “Auditor’s report”) of 2019 annual report, the Auditor do not express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Because of the significance of the matters described under the paragraph (a) to (i) headed “BASIC FOR DISCLAIMER OF OPINION” set out on pages 69 to 80 of 2019 annual report, the Auditors have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion on these consolidated financial statements. Such qualification are mainly the results of the issues surrounding the Six Vessels which the cost of sales incurred, whether the inventories was fairly stated could not be determined and the going concern of the Group. The Management has spared no efforts in working out solutions for the Six Vessels during 2020. It is expected that before the end of financial year 2020, all the Four Vessels and the Two Vessels will be disposed of. Upon discussion with the Auditor, if legally-binding agreement will be entered into in relation to the disposal of the Six Vessels during the year ending 31 December 2020, the inventory would be stated at the lower of cost (including budgeted cost to complete the Six Vessels, if any) and net realizable values as at the year ending 31 December 2020. This audit qualification would be removed for the year ending 31 December For the six months ended 30 June 2020, the Group reported a loss attributable to the owners of the Company of approximately HK$134.44 million. As of that date, the Group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by approximately HK$3,626.88 million and the Group had net liabilities of approximately HK$3,295.60 million, in which total borrowings amounted to approximately HK$3,082.36 million, its bank balances and cash were only approximately HK$2.54 million. It is uncertain about the ability of the Group to maintain adequate future cash flow and the assumptions made by the Directors in preparing the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. Considering the consensus reached with asset management company, several banks and other financial institutions, as well as the intention to cooperate with relevant state- owned enterprises. Also, taking into account the measures as below, the Directors are of the opinion that, the Group will have sufficient working capital to meet its financial obligations as they fall due in the next twelve months from these condensed consolidated financial statements were authorised to issue. Accordingly, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. (a) The Group actively reorganised the shipbuilding business, introduced large enterprises to integrate the shipbuilding business, and revitalised the shipbuilding assets. The reorganisation plan, which began in March 2018, has been promoted around the business integration of Jiangxi Jiangzhou Union Shipbuilding Co., Ltd (“Jiangxi Shipbuilding”) and the cooperation with large enterprises. Although unpredictable factors have been encountered, the overall work is now being carried out in an orderly manner. At the same time, the revitalisation of spare resources of Jiangxi Shipbuilding such as wharfs and lands is also under way and the storage and logistics business along Yangtze River is expected to commence operation in the future. In addition, we also expect to carry out new activities related to logistics through business diversification or merge and acquisition to contribute stable long-term cash flows to the Group; (b) The Group will dispose of part of its assets and investment to obtain funds so as to improve its financial position; (c) Under the government’s instruction and with the supports for real economy and private enterprises from all levels of government, the Group is negotiating with lending banks and asset management companies in relation to loan restructuring to extend repayment date and reduce gearing level; (d) The Group is in contact with a number of investors to issue new shares or convertible bonds; (e) The Group is in negotiation with certain suppliers and creditors to extend payment due date and reduce the amount of payment. The audit committee of the Company (“Audit Committee”) understands the uncertainties in relation to going concern and has discussions with the management in this regard. The Audit Committee concurs the view with the management, particularly, deliberations were focused on the uncertainty and difficulties faced by the asset- heavy related business segments. Notwithstanding this, the Audit Committee believes that the asset revitalization of Jiangxi Shipbuilding and the new business arising therefrom would enable to broaden the revenue stream of the Group and correspond to the Company’s continual effort in transforming its business. Meanwhile, the Audit Committee believes that efforts to reduce debts will relieve the funding pressure of the Company. The Audit Committee is of the view that the Group could address the issue of uncertainties relating to going concern.

Save as disclosed above, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has no other material contingent liabilities at 30 June 2020. June 30 Contracted for but not provided in the consolidated financial statement: The outbreak of COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) in early 2020 has affected the Group’s business segment adversely. The Group has closely monitored on the development of the COVID-19 and taken a number of cost control measures to mitigate the impact of this challenging situation. The Group will pay close attention to the change of situation and evaluate its impact on the financial position and operating results of the Group. Save as discussed elsewhere under the section headed “Management Discussion and Analysis”, the Group had no other material events after the reporting period as at the date of this Report. The adjustment faced by the China’s real economy, together with the impacts to the economies by the global epidemic of COVID-19, have brought new challenges to the Group’s business transformation. It will also be a challenge for to the Group to tackle the above changes. We believe that there would be more measures and greater efforts from the government to support and rescue the real economy. The Group will actively leverage on relevant policies to promote the business integration and debt restructuring of Jiangxi Shipbuilding so as to achieve substantive breakthroughs as soon as practicable and effectively carry out integration of the wharfs, coastline, land resources, etc. The Group will continue to expand related businesses and combine such expansion with the demand from the local governments for investment promotion and capital introduction, and seek various cooperation opportunities in terms of logistics, storage and transportation of new energy, green building materials and steal structure processing, etc. along the Yangtze River. On this basis, the Group will actively create conditions necessary to reduce the Group’s debt burden through the support from the

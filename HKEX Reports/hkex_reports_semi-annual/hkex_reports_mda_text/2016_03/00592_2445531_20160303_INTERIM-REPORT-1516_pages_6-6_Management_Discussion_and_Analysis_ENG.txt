The first is that mainland China’s economy had undergone a major slowdown and rebalancing of economic activity away from investment and manufacturing towards consumption and services. Second, energy, particularly oil, is now much cheaper. Third, the United States dollar continued to remain strong and has continued to create challenges in Asia- Pacific. Hong Kong’s economy continued to be affected by the reduced number of visitors. This in turn has led to a decrease in the number of transactions being made in the retail industry. According to the data from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government’s latest Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales of December 2015, retail sales on wearing apparel were down by 11% year-on-year for the second half of 2015.

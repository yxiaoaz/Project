The Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (“HKDSE”) Examination is the only public examination under the new 3-3-4 secondary education system in Hong Kong. Our star-rating tutors play a significant role to consolidate the Group’s leading position amid the fierce competition. Their seasoned test-taking techniques and versatile teaching methods are effective to help students to come out of the HKDSE Examination with flying colours. The following table sets forth the number of course enrolments, the number of tutors and the average course fees of each category of secondary tutoring courses for the Period: For the six months ended Number of course enrolments (in thousands) Number of tutors (Note 1) Average course fees (HK$) (Note 2) Note 1: Tutors may provide secondary tutoring services for all or certain categories of courses.

Interim Report 2015 43 The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) are two widely recognised qualifications for English proficiency in the society. The Group offers IELTS and TOEIC preparation courses suited to the development and language needs in Hong Kong. The Group recorded approximately 7,800 course enrolments during the Period when compared with approximately 8,700 course enrolments in the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease in course enrolments was partly compensated by 8% increase in tuition fee since June 2014. The Group continues to provide high- quality course materials with experienced and qualified tutors for the aforesaid examination training courses and endeavors to equip students to meet their needs. Primary Tutoring Services, Skill Courses and Test Preparation Considering the increasing competition amongst primary students, extra learning materials are required. The Group has implemented systematic tutoring strategies supported by experienced and high- quality tutors to help students to improve their competitiveness and performance in the internal school examinations. As of 31 December 2014, the Group had 10 directly-owned education centres and 29 franchised centres in operation, which are under the brand “Modern Bachelor Education” . During the Period, the Group recorded a total number of approximately 4,500 course enrolments for the primary school tutoring services, skill courses and test preparation courses offered by our directly-owned learning centres, as compared with approximately 5,000 course enrolments in the corresponding period in 2013. Total revenue contributed by the franchised centres to the Group was approximately HK$1.87 million (2013: approximately HK$1.82 million). The PRC is currently one of the largest economies in the world. The rapid economic development has fuelled the interest of overseas studies. Parents are eager to provide quality education for their children by sending them abroad. Expecting an increasing demand for educational consultation and management services as well as tertiary education, the Group expanded our business in the PRC proactively over the years. With the passion and quality of the Group’s teachers and strategic development plan, the Group has successfully built up a quality brand in the educational services segment in the PRC market and raised the brand’s awareness amongst students and parents. As the education systems of the PRC and those of overseas countries are different, international programmes run by the Group acted as a bridge, offering students opportunities to experience international education. Our teachers, most of whom hold master’s degrees from internationally renowned universities, are experienced in international curricula. The Group adopts a small-class policy to encourage interaction between teachers and students and to facilitate an effective learning environment. In addition, the Group cooperated with a number of top secondary schools in the PRC during the past years and achieved remarkable success. We will explore the possibility of establishing more high-level collaboration with the business partners in the PRC. The Group is looking forward to expanding the network of its international programmes to cover over 10 cities in the PRC in the coming 2 to 3 years.

For the Period, the Group’s other income, gains and losses recorded net gain of approximately HK$4.61 million (2013: approximately HK$0.91 million). Such increase was due to the combined effect of, among other things, (i) the increase in supporting services income by approximately HK$3.24 million and other income by approximately HK$0.53 million compared with the corresponding period in 2013; (ii) the decrease in loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment by approximately HK$0.61 million as compared with the corresponding period in 2013; and (iii) the absence of gain on disposal of assets classified as held for sale of approximately HK$0.87 million recorded in the corresponding period in 2013. Interim Report 2015 47 The Group’s staff costs slightly decreased by approximately HK$0.11 million or approximately 0.37% compared with the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease was attributable to the net effect of the decrease in Directors’ emoluments and other staff salary (including the equity-settled share-based payments) of approximately HK$0.44 million and the increase in various staff-related expenses of approximately HK$0.33 million. The Group’s tutor contractor fee decreased by approximately HK$4.01 million or approximately 11.44% compared with the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease was in line with the decline in revenue derived from secondary tutoring services. The Group’s operating lease payments slightly decreased by approximately HK$0.67 million or approximately 2.61% compared with the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease was due to the net effect of a decrease in operating lease payment of two learning centres and the adjustment in monthly rental payment upon signing of certain new tenancy contracts after expiry of the tenancy during the Period. The Group’s marketing expenses decreased by approximately HK$3.47 million or approximately 21.42% compared with the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease was mainly attributable to the reduction in media placement of approximately HK$3.70 million. The Group’s other operating expenses decreased by approximately HK$1.52 million or approximately 6.15% compared with the corresponding period in 2013. Such decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease of equity-settled share-based payments for the share options granted to eligible persons (other than Directors and employees) by the Company during the Period by approximately HK$1.20 million. The Group did not incur any finance costs during the Period (2013: approximately HK$1.44 million). Loss attributable to owners of the Company for the Period was approximately HK$11.94 million (2013: approximately HK$11.21 million). Loss per share was HK0.91 cent for the Period (2013: HK1.79 cents). In the coming future, the Group anticipates the Hong Kong secondary tutoring market will be almost saturated. More new resources will be allocated to develop the educational services and language training segments in the PRC as the PRC market is still developing and the growth potential is comparatively higher than that in Hong Kong. The management will endeavour to develop by diversifying into other related segments through strategic mergers and acquisitions as well as investments in businesses with strong development potential when opportunities arise. The management team believes prudent strategies of diversifying the Group’s investment resources geographically and functionally will bring benefits to the stakeholders and give the Group a leg up to achieve synergies. The concept of “life-long education” is prevailing in the society because it is a proactive way to enhance individual’s competitiveness and unlock ones’ potentials. There is a phenomenal rise in the number of knowledge seekers amongst mature age groups and working segments. Continuing development and professional training are the key target segments to be focused on in the Group’s development plan. The management believes that the Group can find a much bigger market in the PRC, which is a relatively untapped market up till now. The Group will continue the development of education business there using the existing platform in Hong Kong. With our professional expertise, the Group believes that there is a clear edge for the Group’s existing education panel to further explore the PRC market. Interim Report 2015 49 Developing education services is a long-term commitment and it is of utmost importance to uphold quality. The Group will continue to provide quality education regardless of its operation mode. We believe what distinguishes one education hub from another is the quality of education being offered.

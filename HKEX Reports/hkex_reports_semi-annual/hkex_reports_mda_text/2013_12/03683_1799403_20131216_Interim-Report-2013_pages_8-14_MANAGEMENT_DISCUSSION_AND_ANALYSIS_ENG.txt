Daily Variation Chart of the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI) and the Baltic Panamax Index (BPI) 1 April 2013 – 30 September 2013 1 April 2013 – 30 September 2013 (half year average) 1 April 2013 – 30 June 2013 (3-month average) 1 July 2013 – 30 September 2013 (3-month average) In the summer of 2013, the freight market of dry bulk vessels initially hovered at the lower level. The Baltic Dry Index for the second quarter of 2013 maintained an average of 888 points, which was lower than the average of the corresponding period last year. As driven by the upturn of the Baltic Capesize Index, the Baltic Dry Index ascended since August 2013. With upturns found in the freight indexes for different types of vessels, the spot rates market saw a more significant rebound since September 2013. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) maintained a conservative stance in its world economic outlook for the foreseeable future, indicating that the global economic environment is still challenging. During the period between August and September of 2013, the recovery and rebound of the spot rates market of dry bulk vessels reversed the downward spiral in the freight market of dry bulk vessels since early 2013. This was primarily attributable to the short-term and seasonal factors in the recent months, such as the increase of iron ore imports by China for replenishment of stocks and the outgoing shipment season of grains from North America. Also, the imbalance of supply and demand of vessel capacity in the dry bulk marine transportation market was relieved to a certain extent as a result of the smaller number of newly built vessels delivered and used this year, which was a favorable change for the dry bulk marine transportation market in the medium and long run. With the improvement in the spot rates market of dry bulk vessels during the period between August and September of 2013, the Baltic Dry Index achieved an average of 997 points for the period from January to September of 2013, representing an increase of approximately 8% as compared to the average of 920 points for the corresponding period of 2012. The dry bulk marine transportation market in 2013 would see a marked improvement comparing to last year, should the freight rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 maintain at the current level. During the period between January to September of 2013, the average daily charter rates of capesize vessel and panamax vessel in the Baltic Freight Index reached US$10,549 and US$7,935 per day respectively, which were also slightly higher than those recorded in the corresponding period last year. Various indications had shown that the freight market was at the critical point for picking up. As stated in the market reports from broker companies, the number of new dry bulk vessels delivered and used during January to September of 2013 was lower than that in the corresponding period last year, and the number of vessels delivered was 577, carrying approximately 48 million dwt. The net growth of the fleet was 254 vessels, carrying approximately 30 million dwt, indicating that the growth rate of the fleet had slowed down. Based on the information of the net growth of vessels in the first nine months of 2013, the net growth of the dry bulk fleet was approximately 3%. If such level is sustained for the whole year, the fleet growth in 2013 will be slightly lower than the growth in demand for dry bulk marine transportation, which will help alleviate the current situation of the oversupply of vessels in dry bulk marine transportation market. The demand for marine transportation of various dry bulk cargoes increased from January to September of 2013, among which iron ore imports of China reached approximately 600 million tonnes, representing an increase of approximately 9% over the same period last year; while China’s coal imports reached approximately 240 million tonnes, representing an increase of approximately 15.5% over the same period last year. All of these will contribute to the recovery of the freight market of dry bulk vessels to various extents. The growth in demand for dry bulk cargoes in China is expected to become a more significant factor to the overall status of the marine transportation market. It is the market expectation that the overall demand in the dry bulk marine transportation market of this year can still achieve a growth of approximately 5%. The Group’s vessels managed to uphold sound operational status with its fleet maintaining an aggregate carrying capacity of 418,230 dwt for the six months ended 30 September 2013, which was in line with the corresponding period last year. The Group’s vessels maintained high operation level with occupancy rate at 99.5% and a total of 910.5 days of occupancy. The average daily charter rate of its vessels was approximately US$9,644.47, and substantially all charter hire was recovered by the Group without material impairment. Meanwhile, the Group’s fleet had achieved a record of safe operation and zero adverse incidents. The Group was able to exert stringent control over all costs and expenses for vessel management and had strived to minimize voyage expenses, hence managed to control the management expenses for the Group’s vessels within the budget. As boosted by the increase in the market spot rates, the time charter market for dry bulk vessels regained momentum in the summer of 2013, with increase in the reported number of short term time charters and time charters of over one year. GH RESOURCES was chartered out by the Group under a short-term time charter of three to six months for the purpose of generating a more stable income. Meanwhile, given the relative wide spread between the charter rates of one-year time charters and the charter rates in the spot rates market, and the spot rates were higher than the time charter rates, the Group operated three of its relatively young vessels in the spot market, with an aim to achieve better charter rates return. In order to reduce operation risks and achieve better operation efficiency, the Group upheld its proactive and prudent operating strategies and sought to charter out vessels to more reputable charterers while endeavored to provide better transportation services to charterers, so as to maintain a favorable market image. On 6 November 2013, the Group entered into a memorandum of agreement with an independent third party to acquire a secondhand panamax dry bulk vessel at a purchase price of US$9.36 million (equivalent to HK$73.01 million). The vessel was delivered to the Group on 10 December 2013. Further details of the acquisition of the vessel are set out in the announcement of the Company dated 6 November 2013. Reference is also made to the paragraph headed “Business of the Group — Fleet composition” in the section headed “Business” of the prospectus of the Company dated 27 September 2010 in relation to the finance lease arrangement concerning GREAT HARVEST, the oldest dry bulk vessel of the Group. In accordance with the agreement with the Korean charterer concerned, the finance lease arrangement of GREAT HARVEST was completed and the vessel was handed over to the charterer on 11 December 2013. The market was caught unprepared for the relatively significant increase in the spot rates of dry bulk cargoes during August and September of 2013, and different forecasts on the market outlook appeared. However, a general consensus is that there will not be a significant change in the oversupply of vessels in the dry bulk marine transportation market. Also, the assessment made by authoritative institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)) on the world economy this year as well as next year remains largely the same, that a status of slow growth will be maintained. At present, the IMF forecasts that the mid-term annual growth rate of the global economy will be slightly above 3%, which is about the same as this year, and global economic growth as an impetus to the vessel market and the demand for marine transportation will thus be relatively limited. According to the statistics from ship broker companies, for the six months ended 30 September 2013, the volume of major types of dry bulk cargoes by marine transportation (other than for grains, with no material change) all recorded a growth of more than 5%, while the net growth of the dry bulk fleet for the period from January to September of 2013 was approximately 3%. The oversupply of vessels in the dry bulk marine transportation market will not further deteriorate, but instead may be eased to a certain extent, in 2013. Based on the statistics from market reports, for the period spanning from January to September of 2013, the volume of commodities imported to China reached nearly 1.7 billion tonnes, approximately 9.8% higher than the same period last year. The commodities imported to China in 2013 may exceed 2.0 billion tonnes for the first time, with growth to be seen in the imports of bulk cargoes such as iron ore and coal over last year. This will not only lift the growth of the global marine transportation volume, but also contribute more remarkably to the improvement of the Pacific freight market. There is a possibility that the spot rates market may maintain at its current level to the end of this year if the existing oversupply of vessels in the dry bulk marine transportation market can be further improved, thus bringing the average income of vessels of this year to surpass the average value of last year. Based on the statistics of newly built vessel orders, newly built dry bulk vessels of approximately 50 million dwt will be delivered in 2014, which is less than the newly built dry bulk vessels of approximately 70 million dwt delivered this year, hence the oversupply pressure in the freight market of dry bulk vessels will be further relieved. Amidst the current difficult and volatile market condition, the Group is committed to generating higher operating revenue by adhering to its prudent operating strategies, enhancing day-to-day management of vessels, optimizing transportation to better service its customers and striving to charter out its vessels to reputable and reliable customers at higher charter rates. The Group will also exercise stringent control on operating costs and reduce all unnecessary expenses. The Group currently intends to identify new development opportunities and/or actively consider expansion into other businesses apart from the shipping business, such as the upstream business, to expand its business and diversify its income stream. Revenue of the Group increased from about US$11.0 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to about US$11.2 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013, representing an increase of about US$0.2 million, or about 2.0%. It comprised time charter income of approximately US$4.9 million (constituted approximately 44.2% of the revenue of the Group), voyage charter income of approximately US$3.0 million (constituted approximately 26.5% of the revenue of the Group) and service income of approximately US$3.3 million (constituted approximately 29.3% of the revenue of the Group) for the period under review. There was a decrease in time charter income which was mainly attributable to the decrease in average Daily TCE of the Group’s fleet from approximately US$10,000 for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to approximately US$9,600 for the six months ended 30 September 2013. The increase in voyage charter income resulted from the proactive strategies adaptive to market. Cost of services of the Group decreased from approximately US$11.9 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to approximately US$10.7 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013, representing a decrease of approximately US$1.2 million or approximately 10.1%. The decrease of cost of services was mainly due to (i) the decrease in depreciation expenses after impairment loss of vessels recognized last year; and (ii) the stringent cost control on the bunker and other direct cost related to the voyage charters. Gross profit/(loss) The Group recorded gross profit of approximately US$0.5 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013 as compared with a gross loss of approximately US$0.9 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012, representing a difference of approximately US$1.4 million, while the gross profit margin improved from approximately -8.2% for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to approximately 4.6% for the six months ended 30 September 2013. The improvement in gross loss to gross profit of the Group was mainly attributable to the decrease in vessel depreciation and stringent control over costs and voyage expenses. General and administrative expenses of the Group decreased from approximately US$1.4 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to approximately US$1.3 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013, representing a decrease of approximately US$0.1 million or approximately 8%, mainly due to the decrease in amortization of share-based payments during the period under review. Finance costs of the Group decreased from approximately US$0.7 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012 to approximately US$0.6 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013, representing a decrease of approximately US$0.1 million or approximately 8.4%. Such decrease was mainly attributable to the repayment of the loan principle though this effect had been slightly offset by the finance cost of the issuance of the Convertible Bonds during the period under review. The Group incurred a loss of approximately US$1.2 million for the six months ended 30 September 2013 as compared with a loss of approximately US$2.9 million for the six months ended 30 September 2012. Such improvement was mainly due to (i) the increase in gross profit of approximately US$1.4 million; and (ii) the decrease in amortization of share-based payments. As at 30 September 2013, the Group’s bank balances and cash amounted to approximately US$4.8 million (as at 31 March 2013: approximately US$1.1 million), of which approximately 96.3% was denominated in US$ and approximately 3.5% in HK$. Outstanding bank loans amounted to approximately US$39.6 million (as at 31 March 2013: approximately US$41.7 million), of which 100% (as at 31 March 2013: 100%) was denominated in US$. As at 30 September 2013 and 31 March 2013, the Group had a gearing ratio (being the bank loans and convertible bonds of the Group divided by the total assets of the Group) of about 30.2% and 29.4% respectively. The increase in gearing ratio as at 30 September 2013 was mainly due to the issuance of the First Convertible Bonds during the period under review. The Group’s net current assets had increased from about US$5.6 million as at 31 March 2013 to about US$ 9.2 million as at 30 September 2013, representing an increase of about US$3.6 million, or about 64.8%. Such increase was mainly due to the issuance of the First Convertible Bonds in the principal amount of US$3,000,000 and the effect of increase in gross profit. The Group’s liquidity requirements will be satisfied by a combination of cash flow generated from the working capital arising from operating activities and bank loans and other financing means which the Company may from time to time consider appropriate. On 5 July 2013, the Company entered into the Subscription Agreement with Ablaze Rich in respect of the issue and subscription of the Convertible Bonds at the conversion price of HK$1.184 per Conversion Share in an aggregate principal amount of US$8,000,000 comprising the First Convertible Bonds in the principal amount of US$3,000,000 and the Second Convertible Bonds in the principal amount of US$5,000,000, which may be converted into 52,702,702 Conversion Shares at the exchange rate of HK$7.8 to US$1.0. The First Completion took place on 2 September 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, the First Convertible Bonds in the principal amount of US$3,000,000 were issued to Ablaze Rich. The Company may, at any time within one year after the First Completion Date, issue the Second Completion Notice to Ablaze Rich for the purpose of the Second Completion. Further details of the issue of the Convertible Bonds are set out in the announcements of the Company dated 5 July 2013 and 2 September 2013, and the circular of the Company dated 23 July 2013. Pursuant to Rule 13.18 of the Listing Rules, a general disclosure obligation will arise where an issuer or any of its subsidiaries enters into a loan agreement that includes a condition imposing specific performance obligations on any controlling shareholders, such as a requirement to maintain a specified minimum holding in the share capital of the issuer. As at 30 September 2013, the Group recorded outstanding bank loans of about US$39.6 million. The bank loans, namely the First Loan, the Second Loan and the Third Loan, were for financing the acquisition of vessels of the Group and were secured by, inter alia, the following: Corporate guarantee from the Company; First preferred mortgages over the vessels held by Bryance Group, Joy Ocean, Great Ocean and Way Ocean, respectively; Assignment of the charter-hire income and insurance in respect of the vessels held by Bryance Group, Joy Ocean, Great Ocean and Way Ocean, respectively; Charges over shares of each of Bryance Group, Joy Ocean, Great Ocean and Way Ocean. The above bank loans were provided to the Group on the conditions that, inter alia, Mr. Yan, Ms. Lam and/or any company controlled by them shall jointly hold at least 51% shareholding interests in the Company. In relation to the Second Loan, it would be an event of default if any two of Mr. Yan, Ms. Lam and Mr. Cao Jiancheng cease to be the executive Directors of the Company without the lender’s prior consent. Subsequent to the period under review, on 2 December 2013, Joy Ocean and Prosperity Plus as borrowers and the Company as guarantor entered into a facility agreement with a bank for a loan facility (the “Facility”) for the aggregate principal amount of up to US$16 million for the purpose of financing or refinancing the acquisition cost of two vessels. The principal amount shall be repaid by quarterly instalments with final maturity date no later than 1 March 2019. The above Facility was provided to the Group on the conditions that, inter alia, Mr. Yan and Ms. Lam shall ultimately hold not less than 51% of the issued share capital of the Company.

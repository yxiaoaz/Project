Trading of pipes and fittings generated revenue approximately HK$223.8 million for the first half of 2013, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared to HK$216.0 million for the same period last year. We delivered pipes and fittings to match the progress of the contractors’ projects. Our sales recorded a modest increase as the progress of some projects was at a slow pace for the first half of the year. On-going infrastructure and housing projects in Hong Kong are expected to continue for a few years, more orders will be secured in the second half of the year as we have a strong presence in Hong Kong market. For the period under review, selling and distribution costs were HK$6.7 million (corresponding period of 2012: HK$6.5 million), a slight increase of 2.2% as compared with the same period of last year. This increase was in tandem with the increase in sales. General and administrative expenses were HK$40.8 million (corresponding period of 2012: HK$36.3 million), an increase of 12.4% from the same period of last year. This was mainly attributable to the increase in salaries and allowances expenses, professional fees and rental expenses. Finance income and finance costs remained fairly stable as compared to the corresponding period of last year. It is expected that the construction and infrastructure projects in Hong Kong are very promising. Driven by the Hong Kong Government increasing spending on infrastructure and housing projects, the demand of construction materials, pipes and fittings will remain strong. Accordingly, we remain cautiously optimistic about prospects for the Group’s trading of pipes and fittings. To stay ahead of competition, we will continue to enhance our quality of services. We will strive to proactively review and improve our purchasing and cost strategies so as to improve our operating efficiency. To enhance our strong presence in Hong Kong, the Group will continue to work closely with landlords, professional consultants and main contractors in order to strengthen our relationship and reputation in the market. We will stay focused on trading of pipes and fittings which will provide us with a solid platform to tap on the opportunities ahead as they arise.

automobile battery business. The general operating expenses for the Period decreased to HK$41.26 million (2012: HK$80.73 million) which consisted of, among others, the research and development expenses of HK$0.94 million (2012: HK$18.50 million), depreciation expenses of HK$3.58 million (2012: HK$7.33 million), share-based compensation of HK$1.63 million (2012: HK$3.83 million) and salary expenses of HK$19.34 million (2012: HK$23.69 million). (a) The Group engages in the automobile battery business through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Zhejiang GBS Energy Co., Ltd. (“GBS”). GBS was acquired by the Group on 26 October 2010 pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated 18 April 2010 (as supplemented) (the “Acquisition Agreement”). For the Period, the turnover and the loss of this segment were approximately HK$24.04 million and HK$16.65 million as compared to the turnover of approximately HK$17.15 million and the profit of approximately HK$1.83 million in the same period of 2012. The impairment of goodwill for the business amounted to HK$9.6 million (30 June 2012: HK$4.87 million). No impairment of intangible assets for the business was recorded for the Period (30 June 2012: HK$5.58 million). During the Period, the external factors such as the decreasing selling price of lithium-ion electric battery of the domestic market in the PRC did affect the growth of the automobile battery industry generally. Increasing production cost also had a negative impact on the profit margin and affected the performance of this business segment. Despite the continuing attempts and efforts made by the management of GBS in expanding the market and controlling its manufacturing overhead, the business performance of GBS was far from satisfactory. As GBS had been operating at a loss for the financial years ended 31 December 2011 and 2012 and based on the results of GBS recorded for the Period, the Board is not optimistic at all that GBS could meet the guaranteed profit given by the ex-owners of GBS (the “GBS Sellers”) under the Acquisition Agreement of RMB35 million for the financial year ending 31 December 2013. The Board is of the view that the business operation is not expected to have much improvement and will continue to be restrained unless and until there is innovative breakthrough in battery architecture and technology.

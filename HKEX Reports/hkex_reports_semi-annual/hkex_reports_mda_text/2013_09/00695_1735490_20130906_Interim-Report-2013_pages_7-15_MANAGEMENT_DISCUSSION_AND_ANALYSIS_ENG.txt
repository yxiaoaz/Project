Under the influence of the macro economic slowdown, an increase in cement production as well as a decrease in market demand, the nationwide price competition lingered throughout the first half of 2013. (Source: Digital Cement) The Group focuses on markets in Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province and Shanghai. From January to June 2013, the average price of cement in the above regions dropped without exception, and the average prices for PO42.5 cement in Nanjing (capital of Jiangsu Province), Hangzhou (capital of Zhejiang Province) and Shanghai were RMB309 per tonne, RMB333 per tonne and RMB333 per tonne respectively, representing a decrease of 6.9%, 12.7% and 7.1% respectively. (Source: Digital Cement) In the first half of 2013, the operating revenue and gross profit was mired in a downward spiral as a result of the macro economic slowdown, a slump in the cement industry and the plunging market price of cement across East China, leading to a narrower operating revenue and gross profit as compared with the corresponding period last year and loss after tax of approximately RMB2,938,000. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s turnover amounted to approximately RMB140,762,000, representing a decrease of approximately RMB13,817,000 or 8.9% from approximately RMB154,579,000 as compared to that of the corresponding period in 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in the average selling price of cement from January to June 2013 by approximately 11.0% as compared with the corresponding period in 2012. The table below sets forth the analysis of the Group’s turnover by product type: Sales Average Sales Volume selling price Turnover Volume selling price Thousand RMB/tonne Thousand RMB/tonne tonnes PO 42.5 cement PC 32.5 cement Clinker By product, the sales volume of the Group’s cement products during the Reporting Period amounted to approximately 581.3 thousand tonnes, representing an increase of approximately 5.3% year-on-year, while the sales revenue of cement products decreased by approximately 6.2% year-on-year to approximately RMB138,117,000. The income from clinker sales was approximately RMB2,645,000, representing a decrease of approximately 63.5% year-on-year. The table below sets forth an analysis of the Group’s turnover by geographical region: % of Turnover total turnover Turnover Jiangsu Province Wujiang District, Suzhou Suzhou (excluding Wujiang District) Zhejiang Province South Zhejiang Province (Taizhou, Zhoushan and Ningbo) Jiaxing Shanghai Total During the Reporting Period, due to the increasing supply and fading demand of cement in the regions, selling price of the Group’s cement products saw a significant drop. Save for the slender increase in the sales in Suzhou (excluding Wujiang District) following the securing of a subway project, all regions experienced different levels of decline in sales as compared to those over the corresponding period last year, especially in South Zhejiang Province, which experienced a decline of nearly 55.5% in sales. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s gross profit dipped substantially by approximately RMB5,965,000 or 59.3% to approximately RMB4,086,000 from approximately RMB10,051,000 over the corresponding period last year, while the gross profit margin decreased by approximately 3.6 percentage points to approximately 2.9% from approximately 6.5% for the corresponding period last year. The decrease was mainly due to a steep decline in the selling price of cement during the Reporting Period. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s other income decreased by approximately 6.4% to approximately RMB3,342,000 from approximately RMB3,569,000 over the corresponding period last year. The decrease was mainly due to the decline in value-added tax refunds as a result of the decrease in revenue from the sales of PC 32.5 cement. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s cost for distribution increased by approximately 21.3% to approximately RMB1,110,000 from approximately RMB915,000 over the corresponding period last year. The increase was mainly attributable to a slight rise in transportation fees. Sales and distribution fees represented approximately 0.8% of the Group’s consolidated turnover, posting an increase as compared with approximately 0.6% of the corresponding period last year. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 56.4% to approximately RMB7,404,000 from approximately RMB16,994,000 over the corresponding period last year. The decrease in the general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (1) the inclusion of the listing fee of approximately RMB12,844,000 in respect of the listing of the Company on the Stock Exchange on 13 June 2012 in the profit and loss account for the six months ended 30 June 2012, while no such expense was incurred during the corresponding period in 2013; and (2) the incurrence of addition costs in 2013 in the capacity of a listed entity, including directors’ fee, legal, compliance and printing expenses in an aggregate amount of RMB1,657,000.

During the Reporting Period, the Group recorded a net profit margin of approximately -2.09%, a slight improvement as compared to the net profit margin of approximately -4.84% over the corresponding period last year. This was primarily due to the inclusion of the listing fee of approximately RMB12,844,000 in respect of the listing of the Company on the Stock Exchange on 13 June 2012 in the profit and loss account as of 30 June 2012, while no such expense was incurred during the Reporting Period, resulting in a slight improvement in net loss to approximately RMB2,938,000 during the Reporting Period from approximately RMB7,477,000 over the corresponding period last year. The Group planned to meet its working capital needs primarily through cash flow from operating activities, bank loans and the use of trade and other payables, as well as the proceeds of the Company from IPO. Cash and cash equivalents Borrowings Debt to equity ratio Debt to asset ratio As at 30 June 2013, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately 20.1% to approximately RMB78,724,000 from approximately RMB98,548,000 as at 31 December 2012. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a decrease of cash flow of approximately RMB21,875,000 as a result of an increase in trade and other receivables; (2) an investment of RMB5,000,000 in GinkgoPharma Co. Ltd (“GinkgoPharma”). Current: Bank borrowings –from non-bank financial institutions –from financing arrangement During the Reporting Period, the Group’s bank borrowings remained stable. Bank borrowings of the Group as at 30 June 2013, bearing fixed interest rate, amounted to approximately RMB50,000,000, essentially flat compared to that as at 31 December 2012.

The Company raised net proceeds of approximately RMB57,390,000 from its IPO. As at 30 June 2013, approximately RMB4,257,000 from the proceeds had been applied in the manners set out in the Prospectus, mainly used for upgrading the Group’s production facilities. Utilized Unutilized Use Percentage Net proceeds amount Acquisition of a ready-mixed concrete station Strengthening sales network Upgrading production facilities Working capital Total As at 30 June 2013, the unutilized IPO net proceeds were deposited in licensed banks in Hong Kong and China as short-term current savings in Hong Kong dollars or RMB. In 2013, the Group was cautious about the expansion in the cement industry, due to the lackluster growth as evidenced by all major macro indicators in China and the fierce competition in the industry. Hence, no substantial progress was made in the proposed acquisition of a ready-mixed concrete station and the investment in establishing entrepôts. The management of the Company has been actively seeking investment opportunities in order to expand the business scope of the Group, strengthen our profitability and strive to provide the best returns to the shareholders. As at 30 June 2013, the Group did not pledge any of its assets. Details relating to the pledge of assets by the Group during the Reporting Period are set out in note 16 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. As at 30 June 2013, the Group had no material contingent liabilities. The Group conducted its business primarily in mainland China with the majority of its operating expenses and capital accounts denominated in Renminbi, and the remaining denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The debts denominated in foreign currencies were primarily due to the Group’s payment of offshore intermediary fees. During the Reporting Period, the Hong Kong dollars of the Company deposited in the offshore banks recorded a foreign exchange loss of approximately RMB522,000 due to the weakness of Hong Kong dollars. During the Reporting Period, the Group did not expose to any material currency exchange risks, and therefore the Group did not implement any hedging measures for such risks. As of 30 June 2013, HK$37,000,000 of the IPO net proceeds had been exchanged into deposits in Renminbi while the remaining balance was deposited in Hong Kong dollars. As Renminbi is not a freely convertible currency, the future exchange rates of Renminbi could vary significantly from the current or historical levels as a result of any controls that the PRC government may impose. The exchange rates may also be affected by economic developments and political changes in mainland China and/or abroad, as well as the demand and supply of Renminbi. A significant appreciation or devaluation of the Renminbi against foreign currencies resulting from the Company’s exchange of its remaining balance of IPO net proceeds into Renminbi, may have a positive or negative impact on the Company’s financial position. The management will closely monitor the foreign exchange exposures of the Company and will consider taking measures on hedging foreign currency risks when necessary. In February 2013, Suzhou Dongwu Cement Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, made a capital contribution of RMB5,000,000 to GinkgoPharma with its internal financial resources, thereby holding a 10% equity interest in the company. GinkgoPharma is a company engaged to biological agents, pharmaceutical intermediary, pharmaceutical research and development and technical consulting, technical services and technology transfer. The Board does not recommend payment of any interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2013. As at 30 June 2013, the Group had a total of 252 employees. The total remuneration of our employees amounted to approximately RMB6,573,000 during the Reporting Period. The remuneration levels of employees are commensurate with their responsibilities, performance and contributions and set on the basis of their merits, qualification and competence as well as the opinions from the remuneration committee of the Company (if applicable). In the second half of 2013, the Group will remain focused on the local market. In particular, the Group will explore new markets and expand its market share through bidding on high-quality projects as well as strive for reduced energy consumption, higher production efficiency and lower production cost through internal control measures, so as to enhance the Group’s profitability. In light of the long-term development strategies, the Group will step up the research on the technologies in relation to synchronization of cement kilns for disposal of urban wastewater, garbage and contaminated soil, and will proactively facilitate the transformation of cement production into a green and environment-friendly industry, in a bid to enhance the overall strength of the Group and maximize returns for the shareholders.

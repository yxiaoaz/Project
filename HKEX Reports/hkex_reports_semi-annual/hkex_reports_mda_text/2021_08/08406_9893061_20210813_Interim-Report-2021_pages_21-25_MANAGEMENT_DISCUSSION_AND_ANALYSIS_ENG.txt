(2020: Nil) The Group finances its liquidity and financial requirements primarily through cash generated from operations and equity contributed from the shareholders of the Company. As at 30 June 2021, the Group’s total equity attributable to the owners of the Company amounted to approximately RMB131.0 million (31 December 2020: RMB121.9 million). The current ratio of the Group as at 30 June 2021 was approximately 3.22 as compared to that of approximately 3.62 as at 31 December 2020. The quick ratio of the Group as at 30 June 2021 was approximately 2.02 as compared to that of approximately 2.23 as at 31 December 2020. Since no borrowings was outstanding as at 30 June 2021 and 31 December 2020, no gearing ratio was applicable. The Directors believe that the Group is in a healthy financial position to expand its core business and to achieve its business objectives. Significant Investments Held, Material Acquisitions and Disposals of Subsidiaries and During the Period, there was no significant investment held, material acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries and associated companies by the Company. The Group did not have any plans for material investments of capital assets as at 30 June 2021. As at 30 June 2021, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities (31 December 2020: Nil). As at 30 June 2021, the Group had no assets pledged for bank borrowings or for other purpose (31 December 2020: Nil). The Group principally operates in one business segment, which is the sale of inflatable products and related accessories. As at 30 June 2021, the Group did not have any significant capital commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment (31 December 2020: approximately RMB863,000). As the majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated in US Dollars but the costs incurred by the Group for the production are denominated in RMB, significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between RMB against US Dollars may materially affect the business results of operations. As a result of the business expansion to overseas markets, the Group will continue to generate a significant amount of sales, assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than RMB. In this case, the Group would be exposed to risks related to the exchange rate and the currency in which its assets and liabilities are denominated. A depreciation of RMB would require the Group to use more RMB to service the same amount of foreign currency liabilities, or a depreciation of foreign currency against RMB may result in receipts from receivables substantially less than the contractual amounts in terms of RMB at the settlement date. Having considered the cost effectiveness with reference to the business model, the Group currently does not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy or engage in hedging activities designed or intended to manage such exchange rate risk during the reporting periods. Because RMB is not freely convertible, the ability of the Group to reduce foreign exchange risk is limited. The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily arising from trade receivables and bank deposits. Trade receivables are from customers with good collection track records with the Group. For trade receivables, the Group has adopted the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history to mitigate credit risks. No provision of doubtful debts was recognised during the six months ended 30 June 2021 and 2020 because there were subsequent settlements or no historical default of payments by the respective customers and the amounts are still considered recoverable. Bank deposits are mainly deposits with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies or with good reputation. For bank deposits, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties. As at 30 June 2021, the Group had 987 full-time employees (31 December 2020: 726). Most of the employees of the Group are located in the PRC. The total employee remuneration, including remuneration of Directors, for the six months ended 30 June 2021 amounted to approximately RMB34,305,000 (2020: approximately RMB20,524,000). The Group entered into separate labour contracts with each of its employees in accordance with the applicable labour laws in Hong Kong and the PRC. The Group provides its employees with various benefits including discretionary bonus, contribution to social insurance premium and housing provident fund, and contribution to mandatory provident fund. The Group also offers options that may be granted to employees under the share option scheme.

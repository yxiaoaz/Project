The Directors of the Company (the “Board”) believe that the Hong Kong SAR Government will continue to increase land supply for housing/industrial/commercial sites, sites for logistics use, and sites for convention and exhibition facilities. Hence, the Group is confident about the opportunities in the growth of the construction industry in Hong Kong.

The increase was primarily due to the commencement of a few sizable projects in the second half of year 2016, which were in full swing during the six months ended 30 September 2017. The revenue from machinery leasing of the Group for the six months ended 30 September 2017 amounted to approximately HK$9.6 million, representing an increase of approximately HK$1.8 million, or 23.1%, compared to approximately HK$7.8 million for the six months ended 30 September 2016. This amount represented the revenue contributed by the Group’s leasing of its machinery to contractors and/or subcontractors under operating leases. The gross profit of the Group for the six months ended 30 September 2017 amounted to approximately HK$29.7 million, representing an increase of approximately HK$10.9 million, or 58.0%, compared to approximately HK$18.8 million for the six months ended 30 September 2016. The increase in gross profit was in line with the substantial increase in revenue. The gross profit margin has increased slightly from 10.4% for the six months ended 30 September 2016 to 10.9% for the six months ended 30 September 2017. The Group prices its services based on various factors, among others, the scope of works and the complexity of the projects. In this regard, the Group’s profitability depends on the nature of projects engaged by the Group. On the other hand, the Group prices its leasing machinery based on the procurement cost and the expected profit margin.

The decrease was primarily due to gain on disposal of plant and equipment of approximately HK$1.4 million for the six months ended 30 September 2016 with the combined effect of fair value gain on investment property of approximately HK$0.5 million for the six months ended 30 September 2017. The administrative expenses of the Group for the six months ended 30 September 2017 amounted to approximately HK$20.4 million, representing an increase of approximately HK$14.7 million or 257.9% compared to approximately HK$5.7 million for the six months ended 30 September 2016. The increase was primarily due to the one-off listing expenses of approximately HK$13.6 million for the six months ended 30 September 2017. The finance costs of the Group for the six months ended 30 September 2017 amounted to approximately HK$0.3 million, representing a decrease of approximately HK$0.2 million or 40% compared to approximately HK$0.5 million for the six months ended 30 September 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in borrowings and obligations under finance leases to finance the purchase of machineries and motor vehicles during the six months ended 30 September 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The Group has funded the liquidity and capital requirements primarily through capital contributions from shareholders, bank borrowings, cash inflows from operating activities and proceeds received from the listing of the Company (the “Listing”).

As at 30 September 2017, the Group had total cash and cash equivalents of approximately HK$18.8 million (31 March 2017: approximately HK$21.3 million). The decrease was due to the repayment of amount due to a Director and repayment of borrowings and obligations under a finance lease with personal guarantee. As at 30 September 2017, the gearing ratio of the Group, calculated by the total debts (defined as the sum of the amounts due to a Director, bank borrowings and obligations under finance leases) divided by the total equity. The gearing ratio of the Group as at 30 September 2017 was approximately 9.8% (31 March 2017: 21.3%), the decrease was primarily due to repayment of borrowings and obligations under finance lease with personal guarantee. As at 30 September 2017, the Group’s plant and equipment with an aggregate net book value of approximately HK$2.0 million (31 March 2017: HK$2.4 million) were pledged under finance leases, while investment property of approximately HK$6.8 million (31 March 2017: HK$6.3 million) was pledged to secure banking facilities granted to the Group. As the Group only operates in Hong Kong and almost all of the revenue and transactions arising from its operations were settled in Hong Kong dollar, the Board is of the view that the Group’s foreign exchange rate risks are insignificant. Thus, the Group has not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge against the foreign exchange rate risk during the six months ended 30 September 2017.

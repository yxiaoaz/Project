The principal activity of the Company is investment holding and during the six months ended 30 September 2017, the Group was principally engaged in the businesses of internet services, trading of gold and diamond, money lending and financial services. The Group’s results for the six months ended 30 September 2017 and the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at that date are set out in the financial statements on pages 17 to 48. For the six months ended 30 September 2017, the Group’s revenue was approximately HK$13.56 million, representing a decrease of approximately HK$29.58 million or 68.57% as compared to approximately HK$43.14 million of corresponding period of 2016. The revenue included approximately HK$1.16 million from online products sales, provision of marketing, web design and maintenance services (the “Internet Services”) business (2016: HK$1.12 million), approximately HK$8.21 million from trading of gold and diamond business (2016: HK$33.80 million), approximately HK$3.88 million from money lending business (2016: HK$8.22 million) and approximately HK$0.32 million from provision of financial advisory and intermediary services (the “Financial Services”) business that the Group had acquired in August 2016 (2016: Nil). Gross profit was approximately HK$5.36 million (2016: HK$11.21 million). Gross profit margin was approximately 39.53% (2016: 25.99%). The decrease in gross profit was due to the decrease in revenue generated trading of gold and diamond business of the Group. Operating loss after tax of the Group was approximately HK$332.37 million (2016: operating profit of approximately HK$187.21 million consists of profit from continuing operations of HK$129.33 million and profit from discontinuing operation of HK$57.88 million). The change from operating profit to operating loss was mainly due to, including but not limited to (a) the decrease in revenue generated from trading of gold and diamond business of approximately HK$25.59 million; (b) the net disposal loss of investment in equity securities of approximately HK$68.47 million (2016: net disposal profit of approximately HK$155.01 million); (c) the impairment loss on available-for-sale investments of approximately HK$218.44 million (2016: Nil); and (d) the impairment loss on goodwill of approximately HK$28.84 million (2016: HK$9.70 million) arising from the Internet Services business for the six months ended 30 September 2017. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses were approximately HK$15.57 million (2016: HK$19.47 million), representing a decrease of approximately 20.03% as compared with the same period last year. The finance costs of the Group amounted to approximately HK$2.18 million (2016: HK$5.79 million) which were mainly incurred on the unconvertible bonds and the promissory notes issued by the Company. The Group was principally engaged in the businesses of Internet Services, trading of gold and diamond, money lending and Financial Services. During the period under review, the revenue generated from the Internet Services business was approximately HK$1.16 million (2016: HK$1.12 million). The revenue of the Internet Services business was mainly attributed from the market of Mainland China. The slightly increase of approximately 3.57% as compared with the same period last year was due to the unsustainable growth of the market. This business segment will likely continue to face challenges, competition and uncertainties in the coming years. Any events that result in a reduction in online retail and e-commerce customers could materially and adversely affect the Group’s ability to maintain or increase current level of revenue, profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities in the future. During the period under review, Elite Honest Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, which through its wholly-owned subsidiary, H & S Creation Limited (“H&S”), was principally engaged in the business of trading of gold and diamond. The revenue and the operating profit before tax of H&S for the six months ended 30 September 2017 were approximately HK$8.21 million and HK$0.97 million respectively (2016: HK$33.80 million and HK$1.56 million respectively). The decrease of approximately HK$25.59 million in revenue was mainly due to the intense competition in the market. As a result, H&S changed its strategy to focus on selling to the customers which can generate high margin and resulted a higher gross profit from 3.85% for the six months ended 30 September 2016 to 8.04% for the same period in 2017. The Group expects this business segment will continue to face more challenges in the coming years. The Group has commenced its money lending business in Hong Kong through a wholly- owned subsidiary, Great Luck Finance Limited (“Great Luck”) since March 2016. Great Luck is a company holding a money lender’s license under Money Lenders Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong). During the period under review, Great Luck had made loans to certain borrowers amounting to HK$50 million in total at the average interest rate of 20% per annum. For the six months ended 30 September 2017, interest income from money lending was approximately HK$3.88 million (2016: HK$8.22 million). In view of the increasing demand in money lending in Hong Kong, the Group will proactively expand such business as the Directors believe that it will provide steady interest income for the Group and has been one of the focal businesses of the Group. The Group had commenced its Financial Service business in Hong Kong through a wholly-owned subsidiary, C.E. Securities and Asset Management Limited (“C.E. Securities”) since August 2016. C.E. Securities contributed approximately HK$0.32 million to the Group’s revenue for the six months ended 30 September 2017 (2016: Nil). The Board continue believe that the outlook of the financial services sector is positive. It is expected that C.E. Securities will also participate in providing other financial services, including but not limited to providing securities brokerage and asset management businesses, and will generate more income for the Group and enhance the shareholders’ value. During the period under review, Pure Power Holdings Limited, an associate of the Group, owned 100% equity interest in a company which is principally engaged in the exploration and exploitation of natural resources in Nevada, the United States of America since January 2016. The Group shared the loss of an associate of approximately HK$0.18 million (2016: HK$1.72 million). No impairment was made for the investment in an associate, the crude oil price has risen steadily and the Board is anticipating the recovery of oil industry in the coming years. The Directors will continue to enhance the Group’s businesses through review of its existing business portfolio from time to time and also seek suitable investment opportunities in the long run so as to broaden the source of income of the Group and diversify the Group’s business portfolio on an on-going basis.

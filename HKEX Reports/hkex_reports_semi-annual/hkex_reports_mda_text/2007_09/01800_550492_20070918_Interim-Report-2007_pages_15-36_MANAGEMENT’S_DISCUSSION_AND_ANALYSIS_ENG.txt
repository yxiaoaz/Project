The following section should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim ﬁ nancial information and accompanying notes presented in this interim report. For the six-month period ended 30 June 2007, profit before income tax of the Company amounted to RMB4,425 million, representing an increase of 125.5% compared with the same period in 2006. Proﬁ t attributable to equity holders of the Company amounted to RMB2,744 million, representing an increase of 153.1% compared with the same period in 2006. Earnings per share of the Company was RMB0.19. The following is a comparison of ﬁ nancial results between the six-month period ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006, respectively. Revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB58,674 million, representing an increase of RMB11,487 million or 24.3% from RMB47,187 million in the same period in 2006. The growth was mainly attributable to the increased revenue in Infrastructure Construction Business, Infrastructure Design Business, Dredging Business and Port Machinery Manufacturing Business, amounting to RMB10,418 million, RMB475 million, RMB1,125 million, RMB1,165 million (all before elimination of inter-segment transactions), respectively, representing an increase of 36.1%, 20.1%, 22.4% and 12.9%, respectively, over the same period in 2006. Cost of sales for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB52,200 million, representing an increase of RMB10,127 million or 24.1% from RMB42,073 million in the same period in 2006. The growth was mainly attributable to the increase in cost of sales in Infrastructure Construction Business, Infrastructure Design Business, Dredging Business and Port Machinery Manufacturing Business, amounting to RMB9,293 million, RMB404 million, RMB850 million and RMB990 million (all before elimination of inter-segment transactions) respectively, representing an increase of 34.6%, 24.7%, 20.1% and 12.8%, respectively, over the same period in 2006. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of Sales and Gross Proﬁ t (Continued) In addition, during the six months ended 30 June 2007 we have early adopted the Revised IAS 23, Borrowing Cost, which requires the capitalisation of borrowing cost relating to qualifying assets. As a result, borrowing cost capitalised in the six months ended 30 June 2007 was approximately RMB90 million, of which approximately RMB72 million was charged to cost of sales in that period. As a result, gross profit for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB6,474 million, representing an increase of RMB1,360 million or 26.6% from RMB5,114 million in the same period in 2006. Gross proﬁ t margin increased to 11.0% for the six months ended 30 June 2007 from 10.8% for the same period in 2006. Operating proﬁ t for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB4,793 million, representing an increase of RMB2,276 million or 90.4% from RMB2,517 million in the same period in 2006. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in Infrastructure Construction Business, Infrastructure Design Business, Dredging Business and Port Machinery Manufacturing Business, amounting to RMB1,065 million, RMB71 million, RMB301 million and RMB1,048 million (all before elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated costs) respectively, representing an increase of 170.7%, 20.6%, 66.4% and 104.3%, respectively. Operating proﬁ t margin increased to 8.2% for the six months ended 30 June 2007 from 5.3% for the same period in 2006. In connection with the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, one of our subsidiaries received compensation from the Bureau of Shanghai Expo Coordination for the costs of relocating production facilities. Approximately RMB636 million of the compensation has been recognised as other income for the six months ended 30 June 2007, excluding which the Company’s operating proﬁ t margin would be approximately 7.1% for the six months ended 30 June 2007. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest income for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB203 million, representing an increase of RMB132 million from RMB71 million in the same period in 2006. It was mainly attributable to the interest income from unused proceeds from the Company’s global offering in December 2006. Finance costs for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB616 million, representing a decrease of RMB68 million from RMB684 million in the same period in 2006. The decrease was mainly due to an increase of RMB277 million in net foreign exchange gains on borrowings, primarily attributable to the appreciation of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen, offseting the RMB144 million increase in interest expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2007 from the same period of 2006. Share of proﬁ t from jointly controlled entities amounted to RMB9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2007 and RMB10 million in the same period in 2006. Share of the proﬁ t of associates amounted to RMB36 million in the six months ended 30 June 2007 and RMB48 million in the same period in 2006. As a result of the foregoing factors, proﬁ t before income tax for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB4,425 million, representing an increase of RMB2,463 million or 125.5% from RMB1,962 million in the same period in 2006. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Income tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB974 million, representing an increase of RMB472 million or 94.0% from RMB502 million in the same period in 2006. Effective tax rate for the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2007 and 2006 were 22.0% and 25.6%, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate was mainly due to the increase in non-taxable income of RMB303 million from RMB46 million in the same period in 2006, and was partially offset by the amount of RMB360 million attributable to the change in tax rate and charged to deferred income tax for the six months ended 30 June 2007. Proﬁ t attributable to minority interests for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB707 million, an increase of RMB331 million or 88.0% from RMB376 million in the same period 2006, primarily as a result of an increase in proﬁ t from ZPMC, which is a 43.26%-owned subsidiary of the Company as at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006. As a result of the foregoing factors, profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2007 amounted to RMB2,744 million, an increase of RMB1,660 million or 153.1% from RMB1,084 million in the same period in 2006. Proﬁ t margin with respect to proﬁ t attributable to equity holders of the Company was 4.7% for the six months ended 30 June 2007, compared to 2.3% in the same period in 2006.

For sales of products, a credit period ranging from 30 to 90 days may be granted to large or long-established customers with good repayment history. Revenues from small, new or short-term customers are normally expected to be settled shortly after provision of services or delivery of goods. The management closely monitors the recovery of the Company’s overdue trade receivables on a regular basis, and, when appropriate, provides for impairment of these trade receivables. As at 30 June 2007, we had a provision for impairment of RMB1,893 million, which covers all trade receivables aged over two years and approximately 31.9% of trade receivables aged between one year and two years. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued) Working Capital (Continued) Trade receivables and trade payables (Continued) The following table sets forth an ageing analysis of trade payables as at 30 June 2007 and 31 December 30 June Unaudited RMB million Within 1 year 1 year to 2 years 2 years to 3 years Over 3 years For purchase of raw materials, our suppliers generally grant us a credit period ranging from 30 to 90 days. Payment of subcontracting charges is made in accordance with the terms of the contracts governing the relevant transactions which normally range from 45 to 60 days. Payments to suppliers and subcontractors may be delayed as a result of delays in settlement from our customers. Nevertheless, there have been no material disputes arising from the non-timely payment of outstanding balances under our supplier contracts or contracts with subcontractors. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued) The following table sets forth the fair value of the retentions as at 30 June 2007 and 31 December 30 June 31 December Unaudited RMB million Current Non-current Total The following table sets out the maturities of our total borrowings as at 30 June 2007 and 31 December 30 June 31 December Unaudited RMB million – Within 1 year – Between 1 year and 2 years – Between 2 years and 5 years Wholly repayable within 5 years – Over 5 years INDEBTEDNESS (Continued) Borrowings (Continued) Our borrowings are primarily denominated in Renminbi, U.S. dollars, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese Yen.

This was mainly attributable to the increase of equity as a result of the increase in the Company’s net proﬁ t for the six months ended 30 June 2007 and the increase in fair value of available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets held by the Company as at 30 June 2007. INDEBTEDNESS (Continued) We have contingent liabilities with respect to legal claims arising from the ordinary course of business. 30 June 31 December Unaudited RMB million We have been named in a number of lawsuits arising from the ordinary course of business. No provision has been made for pending lawsuits when the outcome of the lawsuits cannot be reasonably estimated or management believes the probability of loss is remote. We have acted as the guarantor for various external borrowings made by certain jointly controlled entities and associates of the Company and certain third party entities. We are exposed to various types of market risks, including changes in interest rate risks, foreign exchange risks and inﬂ ation risks in the normal course of business. Our income and operating cash ﬂ ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates as we have no signiﬁ cant interest-bearing assets. Our exposure to changes in interest rates is mainly attributable to our borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose us to cash ﬂ ow interest-rate risk. Borrowings at ﬁ xed rates expose us to fair value interest-rate risk. As at 30 June 2007 and 31 December 2006, approximately RMB17,461 million and RMB20,587 million of our borrowings were at ﬁ xed rates. MARKET RISKS (Continued) Our functional currency is Renminbi with most of our transactions settled in Renminbi. We use, however, foreign currencies to settle our invoices from overseas operations, our purchases of machinery and equipment from overseas suppliers and for certain expenses. In addition, a signiﬁ cant proportion of our bank borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Euro and the Japanese Yen. Renminbi is not freely convertible into other foreign currencies and conversion of the Renminbi into foreign currencies is subject to rules and regulations of foreign exchange control promulgated by the PRC government. In July 2005, the PRC government introduced a managed floating exchange rate system to allow Renminbi to fluctuate within a regulated band based on market supply and demand and with reference to a basket of currencies. On the same day, the value of Renminbi appreciated by approximately 2% against the U.S. dollar. The PRC government has since made and may in the future make further adjustments to the exchange rate system. When Renminbi appreciates, the value of foreign currency denominated assets will decline against Renminbi. Fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates could adversely affect us by decreasing any revenues from our sales which are denominated in foreign currency or increasing our borrowings which are denominated in foreign currencies. During the six months ended 30 June 2007 and twelve months ended 31 December 2006, certain subsidiaries of the Company used foreign currency forward contracts for transaction with domestic and overseas registered banks, to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk on individual transactions in connection with Renminbi.

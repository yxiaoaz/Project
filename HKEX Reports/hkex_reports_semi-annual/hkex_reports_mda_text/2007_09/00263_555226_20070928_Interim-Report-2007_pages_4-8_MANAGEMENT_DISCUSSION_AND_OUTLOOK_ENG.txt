For the six months ended 30th June, 2007, the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company was HK$2,269,000 (2006: HK$14,612,000) and loss per share was HK1.36 cents (2006: HK12.04 cents, adjusted for the effect of the capital reorganisation which became effective on 23rd January, 2007). The loss of the Group was reduced by HK$12,343,000, about 84%, when compared to the previous period and was primarily a combined effect of the improved profitability of the Group’s financing and securities operation and lowered operating profit of the power generation operation. For the first half of 2007, the Group continued to engage in the businesses of power generation, trading of iron ore, provision of finance as well as brokerage and securities investment. The revenue of the Group for the review period was HK$234,112,000, decreased by about 19% when compared with HK$287,818,000 in the previous period. The Group’s gross profit was HK$20,952,000, dropped slightly by about 5% from HK$22,157,000 in the prior period. The Group’s power generation operation comprises two coal-fired power plants in Sanmenxia City, Henan Province, the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) with each having an installed capacity of 50 megawatts. For the first six months of 2007, the on-grid electricity sale of the operation was about 324 million kilowatt-hours (2006: 345 million kilowatt-hours) and generated a revenue of HK$86,835,000 (2006: HK$82,775,000). The profit contributed by the operation was HK$5,148,000, lowered by about 47% when compared with HK$9,763,000 in the previous period, which was mainly a result of the persistent increases in coal prices throughout the first half of 2007. On 22nd August, 2007, the Group entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement for the disposal of its entire interest in the power generation operation for a consideration of HK$130,000,000. The Group considered it is a good opportunity to realize this investment and that additional financial resources create will also enable the Group to pursue other investment opportunities with better return. Details of the disposal are set out in the Company’s announcement dated 23rd August, 2007 and the Company’s circular dated 11th September, 2007. The Group’s trading operation in iron ore continued to deliver profitable results for the first half of 2007. The revenue and profit of the operation was HK$122,246,000 (2006: HK$179,424,000) and HK$1,254,000 (2006: HK$1,730,000) respectively, which showed decreases of about 32% and 28% when compared with the same in the previous period. Such decreases were primarily resulting from the wide-fluctuating iron ore prices during the first half of 2007 which posed difficulties on the Group’s management in settling deals. Nevertheless, the outlook for the iron ore market in China, where most of Group’s customers are located, remains positive and management expects the results of this operation will improve for the remainder of the year. BUSINESS REVIEW (Continued) Group’s Operations (Continued) The interest income and operating profit generated by the financing operation was HK$6,070,000 (2006: HK$1,693,000) and HK$11,275,000 (2006: HK$1,692,000) respectively for the review period. Such increases were mainly attributable to the higher average balance of loan advanced to customers when compared to the previous period and the written back of a provision against a doubtful debtor which had fully repaid the amount owed. The Group’s brokerage and securities investment operation recorded a profit of HK$2,558,000 for the current period as against the loss of HK$8,917,000 in the previous period. The profit made was mainly contributed by the securities brokerage operation which recorded significant improvement in its results due to the buoyant state of Hong Kong stock market. The management is optimistic that this operation will continue to perform well in the second half of 2007. The Group disposed of its investment properties in Yuen Long in May 2006 and that the Group’s property operation had no activity during the current period. The Group’s 30% owned jointly controlled entity – Shanghai Hong Qiao Friendship Shopping Center Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Hong Qiao”) continued to deliver encouraging results during the review period. For the first half of 2007, the turnover of Shanghai Hong Qiao was approximately HK$292 million, representing an increase of about 11% from approximately HK$263 million in the previous period. The Group’s share of profit of Shanghai Hong Qiao for the current period was HK$1,809,000, the decrease of about 53% from HK$3,867,000 in the previous period was mainly the result that additional depreciation charges were recognized for certain fixed assets of Shanghai Hong Qiao after a reassessment of their useful lives. At 30th June, 2007, the Group had current assets of HK$446,299,000 (at 31st December, 2006: HK$278,922,000) and liquid assets comprising bank balances and marketable Hong Kong listed securities totaling HK$88,415,000 (excluding pledged bank deposits and bank balances held under segregated trust accounts) (at 31st December, 2006: HK$7,958,000). FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capital Structure (Continued) At the period end date, total bank and other borrowings amounted to HK$231,736,000 (at 31st December, 2006: HK$266,810,000). Of the total bank and other borrowings, about 98% was due within one year and 2% was due after one year but not exceeding two years. In terms of currency denomination, about 78% of the balance was denominated in Renminbi with the rest in Hong Kong dollars. In terms of interest rate, about 22% and 78% of the total balance was bearing floating and fixed interest rate respectively. A majority of the Group’s bank and other borrowings was related to the power generation operation. As referred to above, the Group had entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement to dispose of its entire interest in the power generation operation, upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to approval from the shareholders of the Company, the bank and other borrowings of the Group will be significantly reduced. The Group had conducted various fund raising exercises during the review period and a total of approximately HK$128 million was raised through placings of new shares and convertible notes. At 30th June, 2007, all convertible notes issued were converted into new shares of the Company and the shareholders’ funds of the Group was HK$409,771,000, The Group’s shareholders’ funds increased by about 56% from HK$262,650,000 at 31st December, 2006 and was equivalent to a consolidated net asset value of about HK$1.5 per share of the Company (at 31st December, 2006: HK$2.2, adjusted for the effect of the capital reorganisation which became effective on 23rd January, 2007). As of the period end date, the gearing ratio calculated on the basis of the Group’s bank and other borrowings of HK$231,736,000 over the total assets of HK$919,809,000 was at the low level of about 25%. With the amount of liquid assets on hand and credit facilities available, the management is of the view that the Group has sufficient financial resources to meet its ongoing operational requirements. The monetary assets and liabilities and business transactions of the Group are mainly carried and conducted in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi and US dollars. The Group maintains a prudent strategy in its foreign currency risk management, to a large extent, foreign exchange risks are minimized via balancing the foreign currency monetary assets versus the corresponding currency liabilities, and foreign currency revenues versus the corresponding currency expenditures. In light of the above, it is considered that the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risks is not significant and no hedging measure has been undertaken by the Group. FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) At 30th June, 2007, the Group’s property, plant and equipment and bank deposits with an aggregate value of HK$231,254,000 were pledged to secure credit facilities granted to the Group. At 30th June, 2007, the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary which in turn holds the interest in Shanghai Hong Qiao was pledged to secure a credit facility of HK$50,000,000 granted to the Group. The Group had entered into a long-term loan agreement with a bank under which a subsidiary of the Group had pledged its electricity tariff receivable to the bank to secure banking facilities granted to the Group. At 30th June, 2007, the Group had a commitment of HK$562,000 in relation to construction work of the power generation operation.

At 30th June, 2007, the Company and its subsidiaries had about 330 employees in Hong Kong and the Mainland. Total staff costs incurred during the period, including director’s remuneration, was HK$5,637,000, which represented a decrease of about 57% from HK$13,002,000 in the previous period. The decrease in staff costs was mainly due to the cost savings achieved from restructuring the Group’s securities brokerage operation. There was no material change to the remuneration policy of the Group from those disclosed in the Company’s 2006 Annual Report. The Group’s principal businesses in trading of iron ore, provision of finance, and brokerage and securities investment, as well as its jointly controlled entity – Shanghai Hong Qiao had all delivered encouraging performance for the review period. All such business units contributed positively to the Group’s results and that the management is optimistic about their performance for the remainder of the year. The sale proceeds to be received from the disposal of interests in the power generation operation will create additional financial resources for the Group. These resources will be used as working capital to support further development of the Group’s businesses and for new investments if suitable opportunities arise. The Group is presently evaluating the merits of certain opportunities in minerals and property related projects in the PRC and is currently in discussion for a proposed acquisition of interests in a PRC metal mine. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to focus on improving the performance of its existing businesses and will look for investment opportunities that create value to the Company.

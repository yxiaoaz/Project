The pachinko industry remains severe with markets shrinking across the entire industry. More pachinko hall operators are experiencing management difficulties, such as attracting new young players and retaining existing customers, and a trend towards closing of pachinko halls. Furthermore, the pachinko industry is likely to be confronted with other issues which further deter its profitability, such as revision of gaming machine regulations, increase in consumption tax, and constitutional measures to protect against gambling dependency following the passing of the “IR Promotion Act”. Given this industry environment, the Group, in compliance with various regulations, had implemented various sales policies to achieve continuous profitable growth and cost efficiency, while at the same time striving to provide a gaming environment that meets the needs of diverse fans. These measures included opening of new halls, seeking opportunity for acquisitions of other halls and allying with business partners. The Group has also continuously configured products to accommodate the characteristics of each region, improve the gaming environment and customer service, as well as implement cost efficiency plans and work in unity to create halls that win the support of customers. These measures are proven to be successful as the Group has seen that the sales scale is stable with improvement in customer visits. Operating mainly in shopping malls, like Aeon Mall, with strong ability to attract customers, Dream Games currently operates a total of ten amusement arcades including three small scale arcades for kids, of which eight are in Vietnam and two in Cambodia. Vietnam and Cambodia are undergoing rapid economic expansion, both the average age and the overall proportion of young people are on an increasing trend, while facilities designed for people to enjoy leisure time are still limited, it is then expected that use of amusement facilities will further expand within the leisure market. In addition, this amusement arcade business is extremely compatible with the pachinko hall business we have cultivated over the years. Through this acquisition, we have succeeded in enhancing synergy for the Group including human resources efficiency. We plan to further invest in management resources, to achieve further business growth in the future. In the domestic restaurant business, as a franchisee of the “Lizarran” Spanish restaurant, developed by the Spain-based Comess Group, which principally operates restaurants in Europe, we are currently operating three restaurants in three locations — Shinbashi, Nishi-Shinjuku and a newly opened restaurant in Takadanobaba. In mid-2019, we opened the Shenzhen Upper Hills YOKOCHO which is located inside an urban complex centre named Shenzhen Upper Hills. The Shenzhen Upper Hills YOKOCHO comprises a food court of approximately 3,000 square meters in area, with the participation of 16 diversified well-known Japanese restaurants, cafés, and sake bars. By fusing and coordinating these various aspects in a cross-cutting and innovative manner, the Group is confident that this investment will enhance the market presence of the Group in food and beverage industry. During the six months ended 30 September 2019, the Group had taken several moves over both restaurant and gaming businesses. In respect of food and beverage business, in June 2019, the Group opened a Japanese food court in Shenzhen Upper Hills commercial building under the concept of YOKOCHO, accommodating 16 diversified well-known Japanese restaurants, café and sake bar. The Group also launched 2 cafés inside the vicinity of pachinko hall named “Komeda Café”. “Komeda Café” provides a cosy place for both pachinko and non-pachinko players to enjoy drinks and light meals, and the Group plans to continue rolling out more cafés inside the hall vicinity. Further, at the end of March 2019, a restaurant under the brand “Lizarran” was opened. The Group is confident that moving ahead, in developing a larger number of restaurants, it will be able to fully utilize all of the efficient store operation, service, and quality maintenance and management systems we have cultivated through our pachinko business. The Group plans to continue expanding these restaurants in Japan’s major urban areas. Grasping the economic growth of Asian countries and the expansion of leisure market in these countries, the Group will continue to open new outlets in Asia to develop a wide variety of amusement businesses. Further, with the 40% equity investment in Yes! E-Sports Asia Holdings Limited (“YEAH”), a company with its principal activity being eSports business, the Group has opened up a new business stream in Asia. YEAH is established to be a hub for developing and expanding the eSports business. Through allying with strategic partners, it allows the Group to popularize eSports business in Japan as well as other Asian countries, increasing the Group’s market and business diversification. As for management strategies, the Group will make bold strategic investments in the domestic Japanese amusement industry, centering on the pachinko hall business, and at the same time, solidify each overseas business in order to secure a stable earnings and growth path. These strategies include actively and intensively investing management resources in the domestic pachinko business, building a solid foundation for businesses with potential growth, and improving the corporate value and establishing a stable earnings structure. Gross pay-ins recorded a slight decrease of ¥419 million, or 0.6%, from ¥71,189 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥70,770 million for the same period in current year. The decline was mainly attributable to the (i) closure of two loss-making halls during the year ended 31 March 2019 and (ii) introduction of gaming regulation which all pachinko hall operators are required to replace the old regulated pachinko and pachislot machines with new standard machines (machines with lower jackpot size to de-emphasize the gaming element). The change of regulation in return chased away the hall traffic as these new machines are less popular among the players. Gross pay-outs, being the aggregate cost of G-prizes and general prizes exchanged by customers, increased by ¥21 million, or 0.04%, from ¥57,972 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥57,993 million for the same period in 2019. The slight increase is mainly due to minor adjustment on pay-out ratio to improve revenue. Revenue from pachinko and pachislot business declined from ¥13,217 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥12,777 million for the same period in current year. The drop in revenue by ¥440 million or 3.3% was primarily due to shrinkage of customer base as discussed above. The revenue margin decreased by 0.5% from 18.6% for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to 18.1% for the same period in current year. The decline in revenue margin was due to increase in pay-out ratio to boost up customer visits which, in the short term, lowered the profit margin. Revenue from amusement arcade business increased from ¥768 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥901 million for the same period in 2019. The amount comprised revenue derived from Vietnam and Cambodia amounting to ¥707 million and ¥194 million, respectively (30 September 2018: ¥655 million and ¥113 million, respectively). The increase in revenue was attributable to opening of new amusement centres in January 2019 and June 2019 which generated additional income of ¥25 million and ¥6 million, respectively, together with continuous growth in each game centre. Other revenue represents incomes from vending machines, hotel and restaurant operations. Vending machine income amounted to ¥245 million for the six months ended 30 September 2019. The slight decrease of ¥13 million as compared to ¥258 million for the same period in 2018 was resulted from the drop in customer visits. Income from hotel operations amounted to ¥82 million for the six months ended 30 September 2019 with the average occupancy rate of 75%. Income derived from hotel operation increased as a result of rise in occupancy rate. Revenue from restaurants amounted to ¥386 million for the six months ended 30 September 2019. The surge of ¥268 million as compared to the same period in 2018 was mainly attributable to the opening of one Lizarran restaurant, two Komeda Cafés in pachinko halls close to the 2019 financial year end and commencement of YOKOCHO business in July 2019 which generated addition revenue of ¥53 million, ¥53 million and ¥162 million, respectively. Hall operating expenses decreased by ¥316 million, or 2.8%, from ¥11,166 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥10,850 million for the same period in current year. Major components of hall operating expenses are pachinko and pachislot machine expenses, staff cost for hall staff and depreciation expenses, amounting to ¥3,222 million, ¥2,785 million and ¥2,265 million, respectively, for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (30 September 2018: ¥3,374 million, ¥2,716 million and ¥1,230 million, respectively). The decline in hall operating expenses was mainly resulted from drop in pachinko and pachislot machine expenses netted with the effect of adoption of IFRS 16 Leases which led to an increase in depreciation expense and corresponding drop in rental expenses. Administrative and other operating expenses increased by ¥337 million, or 16.8% from ¥2,011 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥2,348 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in expenses was due to (i) increase in staff costs subsequent to opening of YOKOCHO restaurants in China which requires employees to fill up different posts; and (ii) increase in depreciation expense and corresponding drop in rental expenses as a result of adoption of IFRS 16 Leases. Finance costs, net recorded a surge of ¥466 million, or 209.0%, from ¥223 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 to ¥689 million for the same period in 2019. The drastic increase was resulted from the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases which caused a significant amount of interest expenses from lease liabilities being recognised in current period. Profit attributable to shareholders of the Company of ¥496 million was recorded for the six months ended 30 September 2019, as compared to ¥878 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018. Apart from decrease in pachinko revenue, the fall in profit was mainly due to the effect of adoption of IFRS 16 Leases which increased total expenses of ¥178 million. Basic earnings per share was ¥0.41 (30 September 2018: ¥0.73). The board (the “Board”) of directors (the “Directors”) of the Company has resolved to declare an interim dividend of ¥0.10 (or HK$0.007) per share for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (30 September 2018: ¥0.08 per share). The Group principally meets its working capital and other liquidity requirements through a combination of capital contributions, including cash flow from operations and bank borrowings. The Group’s daily operation is mainly financed by operating cash flows, and relies on short- and long-term borrowings for financing working capital, future expansion plans and unexpected needs. The Group’s treasury objective is mainly to ensure there is sufficient cash flow to meet the payment of expenses, loans and to fund any capital expenditure and commitment that the Group may have from time to time. The Group’s cash surpluses are placed in short-term and long-term fixed deposits to maintain liquidity. The Group has not experienced any difficulty in repaying its borrowings. The Group’s principal business activities are carried out in Japan, with income, expenditure, assets and liabilities mainly denominated in Japanese Yen, as such, the Group does not have any material foreign exchange exposure. The table below sets forth the information regarding the cash and bank balances, bank borrowings, lease liabilities, working capital, total equity and gearing ratio of the Group as at 30 September 2019 and 31 March 2019, and operating cash flows before movements in working capital of the Group for the six months ended 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively: Lease liabilities (Note 1) Working capital (Note 2) Note 1: The balances only include leases under hire purchase arrangement. Note 2: Working capital being current assets less current liabilities. For the six months ended Net current assets of the Group totalled ¥4,530 million as at 30 September 2019 (31 March 2019: ¥6,631 million), and current ratio was 1.38 as at 30 September 2019 (31 March 2019: 1.68).

Excluding the impact on adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, the Group had total borrowings of ¥18,387 million as at 30 September 2019 (31 March 2019: ¥19,502 million). Current portion of borrowings and current portion of lease liabilities amounted to ¥4,999 million as at 30 September 2019 (31 March 2019: ¥4,993 million). The Group’s bank borrowings during the current period comprised bank loans and syndicated loans. As at 30 September 2019, the total bank borrowings amounted to ¥15,381 million (31 March 2019: ¥16,082 million), with average effective interest rates on bank borrowings ranged from 0.92% to 1.80% (31 March 2019: 0.99% to 1.91%) per annum. Approximately 9.1% of bank borrowings as at 30 September 2019 were fixed rate borrowings. As at 30 September 2019, the Group had three floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts with a bank in Japan (i.e. the Group pays fixed interest rates and receives interests at floating rate). These interest rate swap contracts were entered into as a measure to manage interest rate risk in relation to loans of the Group. As interest rates of some of the Group’s loans are on a floating rate basis, the floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts enabled the Group to reduce the volatility in the amount of interest being paid. For the six months ended 30 September 2019, the loss on fair value for interest rate swap contracts amounted to ¥1 million. The Group did not carry out any foreign currency investment and its debts were all denominated in Japanese Yen as at 30 September 2019. As the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries are different from the Company, the Group will be exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from such exposure, namely in Singapore Dollar, Vietnamese Dong, Cambodian Riel and Renminbi against Japanese Yen. The management is assessing the significance of the foreign currency exposures faced by the Group and will consider adopting appropriate measures to mitigate the risk, including but not limited to entering into currency hedges. The gearing ratio, defined as the aggregate of interest-bearing loans and lease liabilities, divided by total equity, was 69.2% as at 30 September 2019 (31 March 2019: 70.9%).

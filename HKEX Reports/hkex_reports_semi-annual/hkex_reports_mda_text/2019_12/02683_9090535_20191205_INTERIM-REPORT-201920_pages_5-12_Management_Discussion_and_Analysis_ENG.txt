Wah Sun Handbags International Holdings Limited (the “Company”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is a non-leather handbag original equipment manufacturer (the “OEM”). The Group principally manufactures and trades handbag products. The Group’s revenue increased by approximately HK$85 million or 23.7% to approximately HK$445 million for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (“1H2019”) from approximately HK$360 million for the six months ended 30 September 2018 (“1H2018”) mainly due to an increase in demand from our customers as a result of (i) the benefit of duty-free and quota-free export of all goods (except arms and ammunition) to the United States of America (“USA”) and member states of the European Union from Kingdom of Cambodia (“Cambodia”); and (ii) the ramp-up of production capacity following the completion of the second phase of our expansion plan in Cambodia. The Group’s sales were still predominantly made to North America, accounting for approximately 81% of total revenue for 1H2019 (1H2018: approximately 67%). For the first three quarters of 2019, the level of global economic growth remained within a reasonable range, continuing an overall stable, steady and progressive development trend, even though the trade dispute between the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”, for the purpose of this interim report only, excluding The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“Hong Kong”), The Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan) and USA persisted. This is one of the uncertainties that are expected to continue to cloud the prospect of the global economy. We believe that risks and opportunities always co-exist. As a market player in the industry, we are prepared to fight and overcome various macroeconomic challenges by consistently adopting the following strategies: (i) to strive to consolidate our advantages in the industry by optimizing customer structure through focusing on those customers with a relatively high gross profit margin; (ii) to diversify our customer base and capture greater market share in different markets; (iii) to enhance our operational efficiency through upgrading existing facilities and enhancing information (iv) to recruit and train experienced staff to enhance product development support. In respect of the industry environment, during 1H2019, the global handbags market is witnessing steady growth, owing to the growing demand for affordable on-trend handbags. The arrival of numerous brands and their readily availability through retail stores and online retail channels are contributing to the market’s growth. The shift in consumers’ behavior away from animal products is also a driving force for our customers to opt for non-leather handbags in order to broaden the product offerings to their clientele and gain their trust and support. During 1H2019, we were able to achieve an improvement in gross profit margin while delivering revenue growth amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. On the other hand, the third phase of our expansion plan for the warehousing space and staff accommodation on the unused portion of the leased land in Cambodia have been completed during 1H2019. To cope with our business expansion in the long run, we shall continue to expand our production facilities in Cambodia and open up more opportunities for our expansion by reference to the latest market condition from time to time. Interim Report 2019 / 20 Looking ahead, there is general expectation that the global economy will continue to be volatile in the second half of this financial year which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The Group is prepared to continue to leverage our market leading position and high-quality services to maintain our relationships with our existing customers and to attract new internationally well-known brand customers. Since always, we have positioned ourselves as a market player with sustainable and stable development in the industry. We are confident that the Group has the ability to rise up to these challenges and to grow organically to become a leading non-leather handbag OEM with full vertical value propositions to its customers from the factory to the consumer whilst maximising the return for the shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholders”). Our revenue is generated from the manufacturing and sales of handbags, net of returns and discounts. Our revenue was derived from a single segment with different production bases. The Group’s revenue increased to approximately HK$445 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$360 million for 1H2018, representing an increase of approximately 23.7%. The Group recorded a significant increase of revenue from customers in the USA by approximately HK$112 million during 1H2019 from approximately HK$229 million for 1H2018 to approximately HK$341 for 1H2019. This was mostly driven by Cambodia’s favorable trading arrangements and the increase in sales of products manufactured in Cambodia with the planned gearing up of production capacity of our manufacturing facilities in Cambodia. Revenue generated by sales of products manufactured in Cambodia and Dongguan, the PRC (including products manufactured by our sub-contractors at their own manufacturing facilities in the PRC) were set out below: The Group’s strategy is to diversify its customer base by continuing to grow its business with new customers and capturing greater market share in different markets. The Group’s sales to its top five customers accounted for approximately 74% of the total revenue for 1H2019, with the Group’s sales to its largest customer accounting for approximately 22% of the total revenue for 1H2019. Revenue (Continued) The Group continued to solidify its reputation for high quality products and demonstrated its strong abilities to solicit new customers such as the well-known multinational fashion brands. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the total revenue, the respective quantities sold and the respective average selling price: Revenue (HK$’000) Quantities sold (Unit’000) Average selling price (HK$/Unit) The increase in average unit selling price was due to the different complexity of products sold. The Group’s cost of sales primarily consists of (i) cost of raw materials consumed; (ii) labour costs; (iii) sub- contracting charges; and (iv) others. The cost of sales increased to approximately HK$369 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$302 million for 1H2018, representing an increase of approximately 22.2%. The percentage increase of the Group’s cost of sales was lower than that of the sales growth during 1H2019. This was mainly due to the planned increase in the sales of products manufactured in Cambodia to approximately 89% of the total revenue for 1H2019 from approximately 73% for 1H2018 in order to enjoy the lower labour costs and the economies of scale in Cambodia while such benefit has been partially offset by larger amounts of overtime payment as a result of a significant increase in sales in 1H2019 by approximately 23.7% when compared with that of 1H2018. With the factors as mentioned above, the Group’s gross profit increased to approximately HK$76 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$58 million for 1H2018, representing an increase of approximately 32.0%, and the Group’s gross profit margin increased to 17.1% for 1H2019 from 16.0% for 1H2018, representing an increase of 1.1%. The Group’s other gains primarily consist of (i) net exchange gains of HK$4.4 million for 1H2019 (1H2018: HK$6.1 million) mainly arising from the depreciation of Renminbi (“RMB”) against Hong Kong dollars (“HK$”) during 1H2019; and (ii) gain on sales of scrap materials of HK$0.2 million for 1H2019 (1H2018: HK$0.3 million). Interim Report 2019 / 20 The Group’s selling and distribution expenses primarily consist of transportation, customs charges, product testing and inspection fees. Selling and distribution expenses increased to approximately HK$19.7 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$18.1 million for 1H2018, representing an increase of approximately 8.7%. The increase was primarily due to the increases in transportation and customs charges as a result of the increase in sales. The Group’s administrative expenses primarily consist of employee benefit expenses, operating lease rentals mainly for office, entertainment and travelling expenses, legal and professional fees and other miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. Administrative expenses slightly increased to approximately HK$23.9 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$23.5 million for 1H2018, representing an increase of approximately 1.7%. Such increase was mainly due to an increase in headcount and their compensation level following the expansion of our operation. Net finance costs increased by approximately HK$0.3 million or 14.9% from approximately HK$1.9 million for 1H2018 to approximately HK$2.2 million for 1H2019. The increase was mainly due to an increase in interest expense on lease liabilities of approximately HK$0.6 million upon the adoption of Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standard (“HKFRS”) 16, “Leases”, which took effect on 1 April 2019. The Group’s income tax expenses increased by approximately HK$6.4 million from HK$0.3 million for 1H2018 to approximately HK$6.7 million for 1H2019. The increase was mainly due to the increase in assessable profit for 1H2019. Our effective tax rate increased from 1.8% for 1H2018 to 20.7% for 1H2019. The increase in effective tax rate for 1H2019 when compared with 1H2018 was mainly due to the result of end of tax holiday on assessable profits of Wah Sun HK Factory (Cambodia) Co., Ltd (“Wah Sun Cambodia”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for four financial years starting from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018 and Cambodia corporate income tax has been set and assessable at the rate of 20% effective from 1 January 2019. As a result of the foregoing, profit for the period attributable to owners of the Company increased by approximately HK$10.3 million or 67.6% to approximately HK$25.6 million for 1H2019 from approximately HK$15.2 million for 1H2018. Our net profit margin increased from 4.2% for 1H2018 to 5.7% for 1H2019, which was mainly due to (i) the decrease in provision of trade receivables by approximately HK$2.3 million; and (ii) the increase in gross profit margin from 16.0% for 1H2018 to 17.1% for 1H2019. As at 30 September 2019, the Group had borrowings of approximately HK$10.7 million (31 March 2019: approximately HK$17.3 million). Bank borrowings were secured by bank deposits of approximately HK$22.7 million (31 March 2019: approximately HK$22.5 million) as at 30 September 2019. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping sufficient bank balances, committed credit lines available and interest-bearing borrowings, which enables the Group to continue its business for the foreseeable future. The Group has committed to maintaining a sound financial policy. The Group continues to improve its operational efficiency in order to improve the healthiness of the working capital. The Group has normally funded its working capital requirements primarily through net cash generated from the operating activities and bank borrowings. The Group also ensures that it has sufficient funds to meet its existing and future cash requirements while providing sustainable and stable dividend return to the Shareholders. As at 30 September 2019, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately HK$87 million (31 March 2019: approximately HK$93 million). The Group’s current ratio, gearing ratio and net debt to equity ratio are as follows: 30 September 31 March (Audited) Current ratios are calculated based on the total current assets divided by the total current liabilities as at the respective dates. Gearing ratios are calculated based on the total debt divided by total equity as at the respective dates and multiplied by 100%. Net debt to equity ratios are calculated based on net debts (being total borrowing net of cash and cash equivalents) divided by total equity as at the respective dates. The Group maintained net cash position and healthy current and gearing ratios, reflecting its healthy financial position. Interim Report 2019 / 20 The Group’s financial management, treasury policy and foreign currency exposure had not been materially changed since the information disclosed in our annual report for the year ended 31 March 2019. As at 30 September 2019, the Group employed a total of 5,645 employees (31 March 2019: 5,060 employees). It is the policy of the Group to provide a regular review on its employees’ pay levels, performance bonus system and other fringe benefits (including social insurance coverage and sponsored training) to ensure that the remuneration policy is competitive within the relevant industry. During 1H2019, the staff costs (including directors’ emoluments) amounted to approximately HK$87 million (1H2018: approximately HK$77 million). In order to provide an incentive or a reward to eligible persons for their contributions to the Group and enable the Group to recruit and retain human resources that are valuable to the Group, the Company adopted a share option scheme on 2 January 2018 (the “Share Option Scheme”), under which it may grant options to eligible persons. No share option has been granted under the Share Option Scheme since its adoption and therefore, no share options lapsed or were granted, exercised or cancelled during 1H2019 and there were no outstanding share options as at 30 September 2019. Staff’s continuous development is one of the crucial success of the Group. The Group provides on-board trainings and orientation for the new coming staff. Also, the Group encourages the employees to attend external applicable training courses or seminars during office hours, which are relevant to their job duties. The Group strives to ensure that all employees can fulfill the relevant job requirements in terms of education, training, technical and work experience.

The increase was mainly driven by the following factors: The Group has been upholding its leading position in conventional curtain wall business and the revenue from conventional curtain wall business increased from RMB359.7 million to RMB389.8 million. We are a reputable curtain wall contractor in the PRC and the growth in the Period was mainly contributed by the growth in public work projects, especially the construction of railway stations. Our BIPV business has seen a substantive growth. Revenue from BIPV business increased from RMB100.4 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB148.3 million in the first half year of 2010. We have involved in 15 BIPV projects in the first half year of 2010, the total revenue from BIPV business increased by RMB47.9 million or 47.7%, such increase was mainly contributed by the increase in demand from commercial customers. With the expected increase in order book, the directors are confident that revenue contribution from BIPV business will further increase in the second half year of Revenue from sale of goods increased from RMB42.7 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB149.5 million in the first half year of 2010. During the first half year of 2009, the total amount of the RMB42.7 million of goods sales were came from conventional curtainwall materials. In the Period, we have successfully launched variety of solar related products, revenue recognized from solar related products reached RMB65.9 million. Apart from that, revenue from conventional curtainwall materials also grew sharply from RMB42.7 million to RMB83.6 million. We will continue devote our best effort in the research and development of different kind of solar related products to strengthen our position in renewable energy area. The gross profit of the Group increased by RMB47.4 million, or 44.3%, from RMB107.1 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB154.5 million in the first half year of 2010. Despite the keen competition in the conventional curtain wall market, we could still maintain a similar gross profit margin of 16.2% in first half year of 2010. The capability of our engineering team and the reputation of our Group in the market allow us to win sizable projects with attractive prices. Gross profit margin of our BIPV business is relatively higher with the margin held well at the level of 36.1% during the first half year of 2010 (2009: 37.0%). In the future, the Group would further invest in the research and development with a view to lifting gross profit margin and upholding our competitive edges in the realm of BIPV business. Gross profit from sale of goods increased from RMB9.2 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB37.0 million in the first half year of 2010. We have successfully launched various solar related products such as solar thermal system and solar street lamp, gross profit from solar related products reached RMB21.1 million in the first half year of 2010 (Six months ended 30 June 2009: nil). The increase in gross profit from sale of goods also driven by the increase in sale of conventional materials, gross profit from conventional materials increased from RMB9.2 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB15.9 million in the first half year of 2010. Other income and gains mainly represented interest income from bank deposits and government subsidy. During the Period, we received approximately RMB1,303,000 from government to reward our commitment on solar energy. Selling and distribution expenses increased by RMB6.2 million or 89.1%. The increase in selling and distribution expense was mainly caused by the increase in staff costs, overseas travelling expenses and business development expenses. The increase in staff costs was because of the increase in number of selling staffs and increase in staff incentive in order to stimulate our growth in long run. The levels of changes for other items were consistent with our business growth. Administrative expenses increased by RMB26.4 million or 83.9%. The increase in administrative expenses was again mainly driven by the increase in staff costs. As at 30 June 2010, total number of employees was 776, while as at 30 June 2009, total number of employees was about 460, total staff salary hence increased, from about RMB9.6 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB19.1 million in the first half year of 2010. Apart from that, the Group has granted options to directors and certain employees in July 2009 and May 2010, share option expense of RMB12.5 million was recognized as administrative expense in the first half year of 2010 (Six months ended 30 June 2009: nil), this is another key factor for the increase in administrative expense for the Period. Other key items under administrative expenses included research expenses, depreciation and other business development expenses, the increase is consistent with the growth in business of the Group. Total research expenses incurred during the Period was RMB7.1 million, which was similar to the level in the first half year of 2009, we will continue our investment in new products research and development to maintain our competitiveness. Other expenses increased by RMB0.5 million. It mainly included bank charges and loss on exchange. The Group’s finance costs increased by RMB0.9 million. It was mainly due to the increase in bank loans. Total bank loans amounted to RMB197.8 million as at 30 June 2010, while as at 30 June 2009, the Group only had RMB65 million of bank loans. Total interest expense therefore increases from RMB1 million in the first half year of 2009 to RMB3.8 million in the first half year of 2010. Apart from that, approximately RMB1.5 million (Six months ended 30 June 2009: RMB3.5 million) were incurred for arranging banking facilities with banks.

Effective tax rate of the Group increased from 16.2% in the first half year of 2009 to 23.6% in the first half year of 2010, it was mainly because the corporate income tax rate for the Company’s major operating subsidiary – Zhuhai Singyes Green Building Technology Co Ltd increased from 10% to 15% after the implementation of the new corporate income tax law. The Group’s principal sources of working capital is the cash flow from operating activities and bank loans.

The Group’s gearing ratio at 30 June 2010 was 16.2%. The current ratio being current assets over current liabilities, was 4.95 as at 30 June 2010. Days Turnover days (unaudited) Trade receivables Trade payables Trade receivables turnover days is calculated based on the average of the beginning and ending balances of trade receivables net of impairment, for the period divided by the revenue during the period and multiplied by the number of days during the period. Trade receivables turnover days at 30 June 2010 was 142 days, the longer trade receivables turnover day at 30 June 2010 was mainly because the aging for several overseas projects were relatively long (between 6-12 months). The Directors are confident about the collectibility and hence no provision has been made. Trade payables turnover days, which is calculated based on the average of the beginning and ending balances of trade payables divided by the cost of sales and multiplied by the number of days during the period, was 21 days, which is similar to 2009.

Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in major financial institutions located in the Mainland China and Hong Kong, which management believes are of high credit quality. We trade only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is our policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and our exposure to bad debts is not significant. Moreover, as our exposure is spread over a diversified portfolio of customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. We monitor the risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. This tool considers the maturity of both its financial instruments and financial assets (e.g., trade receivables) and projected cash flows from operations. Our liquidity is primarily dependent on its ability to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and through the settlement from customers and the payment to vendors. The Directors of the Company do not recommend the payment of interim dividend (Six months ended 30 June 2009: RMB0.02 per share). As at 30 June 2010, the Group had about 776 employees.

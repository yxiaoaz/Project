The Group is principally engaged in the coal operation business involving purchase and sales, filtering, storage, blending, shipping and transportation of coal. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group continued to focus on these business activities. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter in 2009, the global economy has gradually recovered from the financial crisis. There has been a revival in the market demand for thermal coal for electricity generation. The increase in the market demand continued during the first half of 2010. Hence, the Group achieved a significant growth in the trading volume of coal as compared to the same period in 2009. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the coal trading volume of the Group was approximately 4,858,000 tonnes, representing an increase of approximately 213.4% as compared to the same period in 2009. The monthly average selling prices of coal during the six months ended 30 June 2010 were in the range between RMB538 per tonne and RMB602 per tonne, which were significantly higher than the range of the average selling prices between RMB400 per tonne and RMB489 per tonne during the same period in 2009. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group recorded net profit of approximately RMB206.1 million, which represented a significant increase of approximately RMB195.2 million, or 1,790.8%, as compared with the same period in 2009. Taking advantage of the Group’s extensive procurement network and international trade experience, the Group sourced coal from various overseas suppliers. The volume of the coal imported by the Group to China amounted to approximately 69.1% (first half year of 2009: 74.8%) of the Group’s total coal purchase for the six months ended 30 June 2010. Interim Report 2010 Vertical Integration and Improvement in the Integrated Coal Supply In order to secure a stable coal supply amid the fluctuating coal prices, the Group, capitalising the opportunities arising from the substantial decrease in coal prices and the PRC coal industry consolidation in 2009, entered into an equity transfer agreement in August 2009 to acquire 87.88% equity interest in Shanxi Hun Yuan Rui Feng Coal Company Limited (“Ruifeng Coal”) at a consideration of RMB130 million. The acquisition was completed around the end of February 2010. Ruifeng Coal is the owner and operator of a coal mine in Hun Yuan County, Datong City, Shanxi Province, the PRC. The current approved annual production capacity of the coal mine is 900,000 tonnes. The mine shaft has a coal reserve of over 59 million tonnes and the coal is of prime thermal grading. Located approximately 70km from the existing coal loading station of the Group in Datong City, the coal mine enjoys convenient transportation. The Directors expect that the coal mine will commence pilot production in the second half of 2010. Ordos Jinfa Materials Co., Ltd (“Ordos Jinfa”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Acquisition and Debt Restructuring Agreement (“Agreement”) in December 2009 to acquire 60% equity interest in Ordos Bayin Mengke Nayuan Coal Co., Ltd. (“Nayuan Coal”) at a consideration of RMB 857 million. However, the acquisition has been terminated due to the significant differences in the management of the coal mines with the other management owners of Nayuan Coal. As at the date hereof, Ordos Jinfa has received the amount of RMB129 million as a refund of prepaid purchase consideration for the 60% equity interest in Nayuan Coal. Further information was stated in the Company’s announcements dated 19 July 2010 and 17 August 2010. Tiaro Coal Limited Tiaro Coal 21,400,000 Tiaro Coal On 23 April 2010, the Group subscribed for a further 8,000,000 new shares of Tiaro Coal Limited (“Tiaro Coal”) at the subscription price of A$0.25 for each share. As at 30 June 2010, the Group held a total of 21,400,000 shares of Tiaro Coal, representing approximately 30.05% equity interest in Tiaro Coal. Tiaro Coal is a company incorporated in the State of New South Wales in Australia with its shares listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (the “ASE”) with the stock code of TCM, and is mainly engaged in exploration of coal. As part of the equity investment by the Group in Tiaro Coal, a coal off-take undertaking has been granted by Tiaro Coal to the Group, in which the Group enjoys a right of first refusal to the supply of all the coal and other mineral resources produced by Tiaro Coal or its subsidiaries. Leveraging the Group’s expertise in coal operation in China and the previous experience in investing in Australian coal mines, the Directors believe that the acquisition of equity interest in Tiaro Coal will strengthen the Group’s capability in sourcing coal overseas and managing the risk of fluctuating coal prices in the long run. The Group placed confirmed orders for the construction of two additional 82,000 DWT bulk carriers from (China Shipbuilding Trading Company Limited) and (CSSC Guangzhou Longxue Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.) in May 2010, at a total cost of about HK$538.2 million. As at 30 June 2010, the Group had a total of four 82,000 DWT bulk carriers under construction. As the Group’s coal trading volume continues to increase, the vessels will strengthen the Group’s coal transportation capacity, the ability to control the cost of shipping transportation and reduce the risk of increasing shipping transportation costs. Interim Report 2010 The Group entered into several RMB forward contracts with banks in order to reduce the negative impact caused by RMB appreciation. The purpose of entering into these forward contracts is to control the cost of the Group’s RMB investments, in terms of foreign currencies, that are required to be injected into the PRC in the near future. Although there was unfavorable change in fair value of the forward contracts which was reflected as an unrealised financial liability in the financial statements, the Group has been continuously making realised profits since the entry into the forward contracts. The Directors also expect the change in fair value of the forward contracts will become less unfavourable when the forward contracts are close to their maturity dates. Although the global economy has recovered from the financial crisis and the international commodity markets are generally stabilised, there are a number of uncertainties, such as debt crisis amongst the European countries and the macro-economic control, tightened liquidity and policy transformation in China, which could adversely affect the demand for electricity in China and demand for thermal coal in the second half of 2010. The Group will continue to take advantage of the continuous economic growth in China. The Directors also believe that the level of domestic production and consumption in China will continue to increase steadily. These will stimulate the demand for electricity and the thermal coal as the principal raw materials for power generation. In view of the anticipated increase in the demand for coal products, the Group will continue to improve its business models with the following activities: Construction of the Zhuhai Terminal as a strategic integration A joint venture agreement was entered into in October 2009 with (Hebei Port Group Company Limited) (“Hebei Port Group”) for the establishment of a joint venture company for the construction and operation of the Zhuhai Terminal. The joint venture company will have a registered capital of RMB519 million of which the Group will contribute 60% and Hebei Port Group will contribute 40%. The Group will contribute a total of RMB311.4 million (equivalent to approximately HK$353.9 million) for the registered capital of the joint venture company out of the net proceeds from the Global Offering (as defined in the prospectus of the Company dated 19 June 2009 (“Prospectus”)). The total investment amount of the joint venture company will be approximately RMB1.5 billion and shall be arranged by the joint venture company. It is strategically located in the southeast region of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, thereby allowing the Group to (i) take advantage of its proximity to customers located in the coal consuming coastal cities in southern China; (ii) react more quickly to customers’ need; and (iii) lower transportation cost. The berthing capacity of Zhuhai Terminal is 100,000 DWT (construction structure: 150,000 DWT) which enables it to accommodate Capesize and Panamax vessels for coal transshipment. The Group will be able to further strengthen its coal storage and blending capacities as Zhuhai Terminal can serve as a site for blending and storage of coal. As Zhuhai Terminal will have an annual throughput capacity of 20 million tonnes which can also serve as a centre for coal exchange, it can facilitate an advancement in the Group’s ability to further procure and sell coal in the coal trading market. Interim Report 2010 The Zhuhai Terminal is expected to commence operation in the second quarter of 2012. Upon the completion of Zhuhai Terminal, and taking into consideration the four existing coal loading stations of the Group, a dominant and integrated sourcing, transportation and sales network running across the territory of China can be formed. Please refer to the Company’s announcement dated 22 March 2010 for further details. Construction of two new vessels to strengthen existing As discussed above, the Group placed confirmed orders for the construction of two additional 82,000 DWT bulk carriers in May 2010 at a total cost of about HK$538.2 million. The Group has been planning to improve the efficiency of its fleet. The construction of vessels is consistent with this plan. Also, as the Group’s coal trading volume continues to expand, the increase in the number of the Group’s own vessels, and thus its shipping transportation capacity, could enhance the Group’s control over its trading costs and reduce the risk faced by the Group due to any fluctuation in transportation costs. Further information is stated in the Company’s announcement and circular dated 15 May 2010 and 26 July 2010. In addition to the existing customers with whom the Group has maintained established business relationship, the Group is actively looking for opportunities to expand the customer base, developing business relationship with new sizable domestic power groups in China. The expansion of the Group’s customer base is an important strategic step in consolidating the customer base, developing coal production and sales and expanding the Group’s income sources. Coal loading stations along Daqin Railway and in Inner The Group is actively looking for suitable locations in Inner Mongolia for the construction or acquisition of additional coal loading stations. In addition, the Group is also exploring acquisition opportunities of the existing coal stations along the Daqin Railway in order to strengthen the coal processing and transportation capacity of the Group in the region. Acquisition of equity interest in coal mining company as a Although the Group terminated the acquisition of 60% equity interest in Nayuan Coal in July 2010 and received the prepaid purchase consideration in August 2010, the Directors consider that acquisition of coal mine or equity interest in coal mining company plays an important role in reinforcing the Group’s vertical integrated supply chain of coal. This vertical integration strategy will enable the Group to secure stable supply of coal, in terms of quality and quantity, which then can enhance the Group’s competitiveness as well as strengthen the relationship with our customers. Therefore, the Group will continue to identify domestic and overseas coal related development projects for acquisition or business cooperation in order to further integrate the supply chain of coal. Interim Report 2010 Revenue (expressed in RMB’000) Coal trading Iron ore trading Shipping Trading volume (expressed in ’000 tonnes) Coal trading Iron ore trading Due to the revival in the demand for coal-fired electricity and the recovery of the global economy from financial crisis, the Group achieved a significant growth in trading volume of coal as compared to the same period in 2009. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the total coal trading volume of the Group was approximately 4,858,000 tonnes, representing an increase of approximately 3,308,000 tonnes or 213.4% as compared to the same period in 2009. The monthly average selling price of coal during the six months ended 30 June 2010 was approximately RMB557 per tonne, which was substantially higher than the average monthly selling price of approximately RMB468 per tonne during the same period in 2009. The average coal selling price and the coal trading volume for each of the three years ended 31 December 2009, the six months ended 30 June 2009 and 2010 are set forth in the table below: Year ended 31 December Average selling price (RMB per tonne) Average monthly trading volume (thousand tonnes) The segment turnover for the shipping transportation for the six months ended 30 June 2010 was approximately RMB81.1 million, representing an increase of about RMB65.7 million or 426.6% from approximately RMB15.4 million for the same period in 2009. The significant improvement was contributed by the increase in freight rates and charter hire rates compared to the same period in 2009 when there was over-supply of shipping transportation capacity under economic downturn. During the six months ended 30 June 2009, the Group was engaged in the business of iron ore trading and generated revenue of approximately RMB503.4 million. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group did not carry out any iron ore trading activity as the Directors consider that the fluctuation in the iron ore market in the first half of 2010 might bring on additional risk to the Group. The Group’s gross profit increased by approximately RMB332.9 million during the six months ended 30 June 2010 to approximately RMB414.1 million from approximately RMB81.2 million during the same period in 2009, mainly because of the substantial increase in the coal selling prices and coal trading volume. Interim Report 2010 The Group’s overall gross margin increased to approximately 14.9% from approximately 6.5% during the same period in 2009, mainly resulting from: an increase in gross profit margin of the coal trading business from 10.2% for the period ended 30 June 2009 to approximately 13.1% for the same period in 2010, which was mainly due to recovery of global economy and revival in an increase in the gross profit margin of the shipping transportation business from -23.4% for the period ended 30 June 2009 to approximately 21.0% for the same period in 2010 with the increase in the freight rates and the charter hire rates. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group’s other income amounted to approximately RMB39.5 million, representing an increase of approximately 197.0% as compared with approximately RMB13.3 million in the same period in 2009. Such increase was primarily attributable to the purchase bargain gain on the acquisition of Ruifeng Coal and the gain on revaluation of the Group’s equity interest in Tiaro Coal. The investment in Tiaro Coal was classified as available-for-sale financial assets for the year ended 31 December 2009. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group’s other expenses amounted to approximately RMB17.2 million, representing an increase of approximately 514.3% as compared with approximately RMB2.8 million in the same period in 2009. Such increase was primarily attributable to unrealised losses on fair value of forward contracts. Although there was an unfavorable change in fair value of these forward contracts, the Directors expect the change in fair value will become favorable when the contracts are close to their maturity dates. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, the Group’s administrative expenses amounted to approximately RMB73.0 million, representing an increase of approximately 247.6% as compared with approximately RMB21.0 million in the same period in 2009. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in staff cost. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, distribution expenses increased by approximately 49.2% to approximately RMB57.6 million because of the increase in port service fee which was in line with the increase in coal sales volume in 2010. During the six months ended 30 June 2010, net financing cost of the Group amounted to RMB26.1 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB14.8 million or 131.0% from approximately RMB11.3 million in the same period in 2009. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in average outstanding amount of interest-bearing borrowings. The Group’s income tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2010 was approximately RMB73.2 million, representing an increase of approximately 646.9% from approximately RMB9.8 million in the same period in 2009. The increase was in line with the increase in profitability in current period. In addition, the increment was due to the taxation on profit after tax of the PRC subsidiaries arising from the structure contract arrangement as described on page 129 of the Prospectus. The Group’s effective income tax rates for the six months ended 30 June 2009 and 2010 were 47.4% and 26.2% respectively. The non-taxable nature of the one-off gain on revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and the increase in profitability of shipping transportation business which is not subject to income tax reduced the effective income tax rate in 2010. Interim Report 2010 Profit attributable to equity shareholders increased by approximately 1,794.5% from approximately RMB10.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2009 to approximately RMB206.5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2010 due to the increase in profitability of coal trading and shipping business as a result of recovery of the global economy from financial crisis and a revival in the demand of coal-fired electricity, and hence an increasing demand of coal. The Group adopts stringent financial management policies and maintains a healthy financial condition. With the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange in July 2009 raising net proceeds of approximately HK$660 million, the Group continues to fund its business operations and general working capital principally by internally generated financial resources, bank borrowings and the aforesaid net proceeds. The Group’s net current assets as at 30 June 2010 were approximately RMB531.0 million (Net current assets as at 31 December 2009: approximately RMB570.0 million). As at 30 June 2010, the cash and bank balances of the Group amounted to approximately RMB337.7 million (as at 31 December 2009: approximately RMB376.2 million). The liquidity was ample and the financial position was strong in 2010. As at 30 June 2010, the total bank and other borrowings of the Group were approximately RMB2,380.0 million (as at 31 December 2009: approximately RMB2,245.7 million), approximately RMB2,171.1 million of which were repayable within one year and carried interest at market rates ranging from 0.83% to 5.31% (2009: 0.83% to 4.86%). Non-current secured bank loans as at 30 June 2010 and 31 December 2009 carried variable interest rates based on either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1% or (ii) 10% discount on the per annum interest rate quoted by the People’s Bank of China in respect of three-year borrowings. As at 30 June 2010, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, except amounts of approximately RMB157.9 million and RMB47.9 million held in US$ and HK$, respectively, were held in RMB. The Group’s interest-bearing borrowings made in RMB, US$, HK$ were approximately RMB675.5 million, RMB1,645.6 million and RMB58.9 million, respectively. The gearing ratio (calculated as interest-bearing borrowings divided by total assets) of the Group as at 30 June 2010 was approximately 53.3% (as at 31 December 2009: approximately 54.0%). The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held predominately in HK$, RMB and US$. Operating outgoings incurred by the Group’s subsidiaries in the PRC are mainly denominated in RMB while overseas purchases are usually denominated in US$. The Group’s subsidiaries usually receive revenue in RMB. Early this year, the Group entered into several RMB forward contracts with banks in order to reduce the negative impact caused by RMB appreciation. The purpose of these transactions is to control the cost of the Group’s RMB investments, in terms of foreign currencies, that are required to be injected into the PRC in the near future. Although there was an unfavorable change in fair value of the forward contracts which was reflected as an unrealised financial liability in the financial statements, the Group has been continuously making realised profits since the inception of the contracts. The Directors also expect the change in fair value of the forward contracts will become less unfavourable when the forward contracts are close to their maturity dates. Interim Report 2010 As at 30 June 2010, the Group’s assets in an aggregate amount of approximately RMB1,817.9 million (as at 31 December 2009: approximately RMB2,003.3 million) in forms of property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and bills receivable and bank deposits were pledged to banks for credit facilities granted to the Group. As at 30 June 2010, Mr. XU Jihua, the chairman of the Board and an executive Director, provided guarantees to banks for granting banking facilities of an amount equivalent to approximately RMB1,199.8 million to the Group. As at 30 June 2010, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities. The Directors do not recommend any interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2010. As at 30 June 2010, the Group employed 481 employees. The Group has adopted a performance-based reward system to motivate its staff and such system is reviewed on a regular basis. In addition to the basic salaries, year-end bonuses may be offered to those staff members with outstanding performance. Members of the Group established in the PRC are also subject to social insurance contribution plans organised by the PRC government. In accordance with the relevant national and local labour and social welfare laws and regulations, members of the Group established in the PRC are required to pay on behalf of their employees a monthly social insurance premium covering pension insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance and other relevant insurance. Members of the Group incorporated in Hong Kong have participated in mandatory provident fund scheme, if applicable, in accordance with the applicable Hong Kong laws and regulations. Moreover, the Pre-IPO Share Option Scheme (as defined in the Prospectus) was adopted in June 2009 to reward staff members who have made contribution to the success of the Group. As at 30 June 2010, options to subscribe for an aggregate of 8,000,000 Shares were granted to an executive Director and 23 employees of the Group. The Directors believe that the compensation packages offered by the Group to its staff members are competitive in comparison with market standards and practices.

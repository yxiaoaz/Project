Adjusted net profit under non-HKFRS financial measures is defined as profit for the period attributable to owners of the Company excluding interest expenses on discount of compensation payable for the Conversion of Huali College, exchange gains/(losses) and fair value gains on investment properties. As such items are non-recurring in nature and not related to the performance of the Group’s operation, the Directors consider that the presentation of the Group’s adjusted net profit under non-HKFRS financial measures by eliminating the impact of certain non-recurring items can better reflect the operational performance during the respective periods. Furthermore, the Group’s management also uses the non-HKFRS financial measures to assess the Group’s operating performance and formulate business plans.

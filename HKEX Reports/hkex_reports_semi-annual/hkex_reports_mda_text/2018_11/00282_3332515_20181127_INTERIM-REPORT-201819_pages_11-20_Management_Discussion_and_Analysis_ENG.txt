HK$661.4 million (six months ended 30 September 2017: HK$775.1 million) of which HK$291.4 million and HK$370.0 million (six months ended 30 September 2017: HK$294.4 million and HK$480.7 million) were attributable to the Digital Business Division and Print Business Division respectively. The Group recorded an unaudited consolidated loss of HK$287.5 million for the period, compared with a loss of HK$171.5 million recorded for same period of 2017, representing an increase in the loss amount of 67.6% or HK$116.0 million. This was mainly attributable to declining advertising spending caused by depressed market sentiment and weak economic growth in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as to an accelerated global trend towards programmatic online advertising. In addition, customer preferences continued to shift away from print publications and towards digital media. The Group introduced a new scheme to award shares in the Company to all permanent staff in both Hong Kong and Taiwan. This scheme has the dual aim of increasing staff morale and motivation, and aligning the interests of staff with that of shareholders. The total amount of share awards granted in June 2018 was approximately HK$50.5 million. At the same time, the Group underwent restructuring procedures for certain publications, which necessarily resulted in the layoff of some employees. During the period, restructurings incurred payments in lieu of notice of HK$27.9 million (six months ended 30 September 2017: HK$8.1 million). As a result, the Company recorded a basic loss per share of HK11.3 cents for the period, compared to a basic loss per share of HK7.0 cents in the same period last year. The Group’s operations in Hong Kong and elsewhere accounted for about 65.7% of total revenue during the six months ended 30 September 2018, compared with 61.3% in last corresponding period, while its Taiwan operations contributed 34.3% of its total revenue, compared with 38.7% in the corresponding period of last year. The Group continued to commit strategic investment resources to its digital business, which recorded a loss in its Hong Kong and Taiwan operations. In August, the Group established a Business Development Department. This department will enable the Group to adopt a more proactive and dynamic approach to programmatic advertising, thus realising greater revenue from the Group’s digital asset inventory. The Group also continued to develop its iBeacon network, investing in technological improvements in order to widen service coverage, and planning promotional activity to raise iBeacon’s market profile. The Group’s print business experienced further challenges during the period under review. While many of its print publications still retain a core mainstream readership, overall customer habits and preferences have continued to shift from print to digital media, which has adversely affected the performance of its print titles. In line with this trend, the Group migrated its last remaining print magazine title, Taiwan Next Magazine, to a digital-only platform in April 2018. Due to its reduced printing needs, the Group closed its printing presses in Gangshan, Taiwan, and now prints all of its publications at its remaining presses in Xia Wu, realising significant cost savings. The Group also assumed direct control of its Hong Kong newspaper distribution operations as of 16 August 2018, allowing it to significantly reduce distribution costs and improve the flexibility and effectiveness of its distribution operations. Digitalisation remains a relentless and pervasive trend. The Group has fully aligned its business strategy to embrace the commercial opportunities of digital media by stepping up investment in online content creation and developing its digital content collaboration offering for advertisers. As a result, the Group’s digital platforms achieved improvement in unique users and page views during the period under review. Through the integrated Apple Daily platform, readers can access all of the Group’s magazines, including Next Magazine, Eat & Travel Weekly and Ketchup. This platform continues to attract a significant number of readers and page views. The combined platforms for Hong Kong and Taiwan together have commanded an average monthly page view count of 2.1 billion1, making it one of the leading news sites in the world. The Group offers digital versions of Apple Daily, featuring video and animation, branded in the “Apple Actionnews” signature style. This has remained the most popular news source for mobile devices in Hong Kong and Taiwan. During the period under review, Apple Daily had a large user base of 5.1 million2 monthly unique visitors in Hong Kong, 11.9 million2 monthly unique visitors in Taiwan, 1.5 million1 monthly unique visitors in the USA and 389,0001 monthly unique visitors in Canada. This broad user base allowed the Group to capitalise on a wide range of advertising revenue generation opportunities during the period, including on-going diversification into the SME merchant market. The e-classified division in this segment recorded revenue of HK$5.7 million for the period. The Group continued to develop and optimise its pioneering virtual reality (VR) product offering. In addition, its online games business recorded a profit and successfully undertook a number of creative collaborations involving animation content and online gaming. Apple Daily’s digital platform remains the market leader in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Despite this, the Division’s external revenue, which consists of subscription fees, online advertising revenue, content licensing payments, games and content sponsorship and in-app purchase of virtual products, slightly decreased by 1.0% or HK$3.0 million to HK$291.4 million during the period, compared to HK$294.4 million for the same period last year. This was primarily attributable to declining advertising revenues, a drop in programmatic advertising sales, and the costs associated with the employee share award scheme and the Group’s increased investment in content creation. The Digital Business Division’s segment loss amounted to HK$49.6 million during the period under review, compared with a segment loss of HK$22.9 million in the last corresponding period, representing an increase in loss amount of 116.6% or HK$26.7 million. This was mainly attributable to advertising revenues declining for the reasons outlined above, as well as to increased costs. During the six months ended 30 September 2018, the total revenue of the Print Business Division was HK$370.0 million, representing a decrease of 23.0% or HK$110.7 million against the figure of HK$480.7 million for the last corresponding period. The Division’s revenue accounted for 55.9% of the Group’s total revenue and Apple Daily and Taiwan Apple Daily remained the largest contributors to the Division. The Division’s segment loss was HK$238.1 million during the period under review, an increase in loss amount of 65.9% or HK$94.6 million compared with the segment loss of HK$143.5 million recorded in the same period of 2017. This was mainly attributable to the decline in advertising revenue and circulation income of the Group’s newspapers during the period, combined with high employee redundancy costs from restructuring, increased investment in content and a significant year-on-year increase in the direct costs of newspaper printing. Apple Daily, known for its vibrant editorial content, liberal stance and uncompromising reporting, retained its position as Hong Kong’s most widely read paid-for daily and one of its best-selling newspapers. Its average net circulation per issue averaged 110,1773 copies per day between January and June 2018, compared with 124,9674 copies per day in the same period last year. Apple Daily’s total revenue stood at HK$117.0 million during the reporting period, representing a decrease of 17.3% or HK$24.4 million against the figure of HK$141.4 million recorded in the same period last year. Of this, advertising revenue accounted for HK$32.5 million and circulation income for HK$84.5 million, representing a decrease of 30.1% or HK$14.0 million and 11.0% or HK$10.4 million as compared to the respective figures of HK$46.5 million and HK$94.9 million for the same period last year. The advertising categories that made the largest contributions to revenue were the health product, loan, property and automobile sectors. Taiwan Apple Daily, known for its editorial independence and attention-grabbing design, is one of the most widely read paid-for daily newspapers on the island. Its average net circulation per issue was 174,475 copies per day during the period, compared with 209,537 copies per day in the same period of 2017. Its total revenue amounted to HK$139.3 million during the period under review, a decline of 28.9% or HK$56.5 million against the HK$195.8 million recorded in the last corresponding period. Of this, advertising revenue accounted for HK$87.6 million and circulation income for HK$50.6 million, representing a decrease of 32.3% or HK$41.7 million and 23.0% or HK$15.1 million as compared to the respective figures of HK$129.3 million and HK$65.7 million for the same period last year. Key advertising categories during the period under review included the property, decoration and furnishing, telecommunications, consumer electronics, automobile and travel sectors. The Group took the strategic decision to cease publication of Taiwan Sharp Daily, a free newspaper distributed throughout the Taipei metro network on weekday mornings, on 31 August 2018. This was largely to prevent internal competition with Taiwan Apple Daily, with which it had significant overlap in terms of both potential readership and advertiser base. Prior to its closure, Taiwan Sharp Daily’s daily print run was 90,133 copies (2017: 90,162 copies). It generated most of its advertising revenue from the restaurant and travel sectors, as well as banking institutions and government agencies. ADPL, the Group’s newspaper printing operation, continued to make contributions to the Group despite being adversely affected by Apple Daily’s declining print circulation. Its revenue during the period under review amounted to HK$66.1 million, a decrease of 11.7% or HK$8.8 million compared to the figure of HK$74.9 million achieved in the corresponding period last year. ADPL realised HK$36.0 million in revenue from external customers (total revenue minus transactions related to printing the Group’s own publications), including printing assignments from local and overseas newspapers, during the reporting period. This was 12.2% or HK$5.0 million less than the figure of HK$41.0 million recorded in the last corresponding period. The Group’s commercial printing operation, secured a number of competitive bids during the reporting period and recorded a revenue of HK$65.4 million in the six months ended 30 September 2018, which was 51.7% or HK$22.3 million more than its revenue of HK$43.1 million in the same period last year. The shift towards digitalisation continues to disrupt and transform the media industry. To capitalise on this, the Group will invest in original and engaging content while being smart and adept at creating commercial value across new platforms. The Group will continue to invest in developing the technology and talent required to achieve growth in its digital business. To maintain its competitive advantage, it will deploy resources to video, animation, VR, online games and other new technologies. To turn programmatic advertising from a threat into an opportunity, the Group’s new Business Development Department will build deeper relationships with advertisers and optimise revenue generation across the Group’s whole range of content inventory. The Group will also utilise big data analysis techniques to glean more precise information about readers’ habits and preferences, allowing it to deliver personalised advertisements. Traditional print media remains a core element of the Group’s business. It will maintain market leadership in the print media sector through strict cost discipline, smarter use of data, more efficient workflows and streamlined management and operational processes. It will continue to enhance the quality of its print content by engaging more contributors and columnists, and by devoting more resources to investigative journalism, commentary, insight and in-depth analysis. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, the Hong Kong economy is expected to improve slightly, driven by stronger consumer confidence and solid capital markets performance, while higher public spending in Taiwan may cushion recent economic deceleration and deliver moderate growth. However, there is a major concern that rising trade protectionism could depress growth and damage market confidence worldwide. Within this challenging environment, the Group continues to receive the firm financial support of its controlling shareholder who signed a Loan Agreement with the Company on 8 November 2018 in which he agreed to provide an unsecured, interest-free, 36-month term loan facility to the Company of an aggregate maximum principal amount of HK$500.0 million, to be drawn down only as needed to meet the Group’s working capital requirements (please refer to note 23(i) to the financial statements for details of the Loan Agreement.). With this solid financial backing in place, the Group remains fully prepared to grasp value creation opportunities as they arise, while always investing in its core purpose of creating engaging content. Sources: Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited (January — June 2018) Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited (January — June 2017) The Group finances its operations principally with cash flow generated by its continuing operating activities and, to a lesser extent, bank facilities by its principal bankers. As at 30 September 2018, the Group recorded net cash of approximately HK$202.2 million. As at 30 September 2018, the Group had available banking facilities of a total of HK$579.2 million, of which HK$577.7 million had been utilised. The Group’s bank borrowings amounted to HK$574.2 million, with a maturity profile spread over a period of five years and approximately HK$369.1 million repayable within three years. There was no seasonality in the Group’s bank borrowing requirements, and all the monies borrowed bore interest at floating rates. The Group’s bank borrowings are denominated in HK$ and NT$. As at 30 September 2018, the Group’s aggregate bank balances and cash reserves, including restricted bank balances, amounted to HK$203.7 million (31 March 2018: HK$305.0 million). The Group’s current ratio on the same date was 88.7%, compared to 133.6% as at 31 March 2018. On the same date, its gearing ratio amounted to 23.9%, compared to 18.7% as at 31 March 2018. These figures were calculated by dividing its long-term liabilities, including current portions, by total asset value. During the period, the Group drew down a bank loan of NT$400.0 million (equivalent to HK$102.5 million) from a bank in Taiwan and obtained a new short term revolving loan of NT$40.0 million (equivalent to HK$10.3 million) from a bank in Taiwan. New bank loans raised were for general working capital purposes. As at 30 September 2018, the Group had pledged its properties situated in Taiwan with an aggregate carrying value of HK$612.3 million to various banks as security for banking facilities granted to it. As at 30 September 2018, the Company’s total amount of issued and fully paid share capital was HK$2,486.2 million (31 March 2018: HK$2,435.6 million) and the total number of issued Shares with no par value was 2,634,169,487 Shares (31 March 2018: 2,432,026,881 Shares). The Group’s assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in HK$ or NT$. Its exchange exposure to NT$ is due to its existing digital and print businesses in Taiwan. It reduces this exposure by arranging bank loans in NT$. As at 30 September 2018, the Group’s net currency exposure stood at NT$2,474.2 million (equivalent to HK$634.3 million), a decrease of 2.7% on the figure of NT$2,543.0 million (equivalent to HK$685.8 million) as at 31 March 2018. The Group’s capital expenditure for the six months ended 30 September 2018 totalled HK$17.0 million (six months ended 30 September 2017: HK$16.8 million). As at 30 September 2018, the Group’s outstanding capital commitments were HK$16.1 million (31 March 2018: HK$3.3 million). (a) As at 30 September 2018, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of a number of legal proceedings in Hong Kong and Taiwan arising in the normal course of its publishing business. The Group has accrued HK$48.4 million (31 March 2018: HK$40.5 million) as provisions. These provisions were recognised in respect of the outstanding legal proceedings based on advice obtained from the Company’s legal counsel. (b) Contingent Liabilities Arising from Proposed Disposal of Hong Kong Next Magazine and On 5 February 2018, Gossip Daily Limited (“GDL”) as Plaintiff issued a writ against Next Media Magazines Limited as 1st Defendant, Ideal Vegas Limited as 2nd Defendant and Next Digital as 3rd Defendant (collectively, the “Defendants”) in respect of which GDL claimed against the Defendants for, among others, declarations, damages, specific performance and/or restitution, in respect of the Defendants’ alleged breaches of contract and unjust enrichment arising out of or in connection with the sales and purchase agreement dated 25 August 2017 (“SPA”). On 10 April 2018, GDL amended the writ of summons to claim against the Defendants for, among other things, (i) return of deposits paid of HK$88.0 million; (ii) an additional amount of HK$88.0 million as liquidated damages; (iii) consequential losses of NT$900.0 million (equivalent to approximately HK$240.0 million); and (iv) unspecified damages for loss caused by other torts. As the SPA specifically provides that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the SPA shall be dealt with by way of arbitration instead of court proceedings, the Defendants therefore commenced arbitration proceedings against GDL at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) on 9 April 2018 and also applied for a stay of the litigation proceeding wrongfully initiated by GDL in the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong. A hearing for such application took place on 7 August 2018 and judgement was delivered on 27 August 2018. The court has found in favour of the Defendants and stayed all GDL’s claims to arbitration and ordered GDL to pay the Defendants’ costs of the application on an indemnity basis. GDL subsequently amended its defence and counterclaim on 14 September 2018 and the Defendants submitted their amended statement of reply and defence to counterclaim to the Arbitral Tribunal on 3 October 2018. The Defendants consider GDL’s allegations and claims to be utterly wrong and ill-founded and will continue to defend their position vigorously in the Arbitration proceedings at the HKIAC. (c) In connection with the acquisition of Database Gateway Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Acquired Group”) on 26 October 2001, the Group may be subject to contingent liabilities including all payments, claims, suits, damages and settlement payments and any associated costs and expenses arising, made or incurred after 26 October 2001 arising out of or in connection with (1) any third-party claims made against the Acquired Group on and before 26 October 2001, (2) defamation claims, claims for infringement of intellectual property rights and other proceedings and claims which may in the future arise from the content of the newspapers and magazines published by the Acquired Group on and at any time before 26 October 2001, and (3) the contractor dispute with UDL Contracting Limited. Mr. Lai, the controlling shareholder of the Company, has undertaken to provide unlimited personal indemnities to the Acquired Group against all contingent liabilities (the “Indemnity”). In relation to the Indemnity, Mr. Lai also procured a bank guarantee of HK$60.0 million for a term of three years up to 25 October 2016 and the guarantee was renewed on 26 October 2016 for a further term of three years up to 25 October 2019, in favour of the Company and the Acquired Group in respect of his obligations under the Indemnity. (d) Next Digital and its subsidiaries also maintain contingent liabilities that are related to various corporate guarantees the Group has provided to financial institutions for facilities utilised by certain of its subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries. As at 30 September 2018, these contingent liabilities amounted to HK$579.2 million (31 March 2018: HK$618.3 million), HK$577.7 million (31 March 2018: HK$489.0 million) of which has been utilised by certain of its subsidiaries. As at 30 September 2018, the Group employed a total of 2,511 employees, of whom 1,321 were in Hong Kong and 1,190 were in Taiwan, following a restructuring. In June, the Group introduced a groundbreaking share award scheme for its employees in Hong Kong and Taiwan. All permanent employees were given shares in the Company equivalent to the value of either one month’s or a half month’s salary without any vesting period, which they are free to hold or sell at their own discretion once shares have been granted. This scheme, unprecedented among the Hong Kong and Taiwan media sector, aims to cultivate a sense of belonging and ownership among staff and increase talent retention and morale. In order to attract and retain talent, the Group also introduced a number of employee wellbeing initiatives. Employees now enjoy free refreshments in the office and free gifts such as moon cakes and fresh seasonal fruits for festivals and holidays. The staff canteens in both the Hong Kong and Taiwan offices are currently undergoing renovation. Save for the above, there were no material changes to the policies regarding employee remuneration, bonuses, share incentive schemes and staff development disclosed in the 2017/18 annual report of the Company. During the period under review, the total staff costs of the Group amounted to HK$540.4 million, compared to HK$536.5 million incurred for the same period last year. The Directors have resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 September 2018 (six months ended 30 September 2017: nil). This interim report contains several statements that are “forward-looking”, or which use various “forward- looking” terminologies. Such statements are based on the current beliefs, assumptions, expectations and projections of the Directors regarding the industry and markets in which the Group is active. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors beyond the control of the Group.

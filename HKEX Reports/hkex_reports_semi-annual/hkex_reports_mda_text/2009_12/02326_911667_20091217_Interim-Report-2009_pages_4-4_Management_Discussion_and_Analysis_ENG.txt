The loss for the period from continuing operation was HK$3,113,000, decreased significantly when compared to the loss of HK$5,372,000 recorded in the corresponding period last year. Basic loss per share for continuing operation was HK0.06 cent, compared to a loss per share of HK0.11 cent in the previous period. The improvement in the Group’s results was primarily attributable to the tightened control on operating costs, profit contributed by the continuing operation of the Group and the gain on winding up of a subsidiary, BEP Management Services Limited (“BEPMS”). For the period under review, the Group has been principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic consumer products business. Following the cessation of operation of the Group’s manufacturing facilities owned by BEP (China) in October 2008, the Group has restructured its business by leasing certain production facilities of a manufacturing company in the PRC to continue its manufacturing operation. Appropriate measures have been taken by the management covering sourcing of parts and materials, production, sales and delivery of goods in order to support this new mode of manufacturing operation. The results so far are encouraging with that quality of products are well received by customers whilst a healthy profit margin can be maintained by the Group. In addition to active marketing of the Group’s existing product lines of electrical and electronic consumer products, the management is also in negotiation with potential customers for the development and sales of new products that are of higher profit margin and strong prospective demand. The management expects that there will be encouraging growth of the Group’s business for the remainder of the financial year.

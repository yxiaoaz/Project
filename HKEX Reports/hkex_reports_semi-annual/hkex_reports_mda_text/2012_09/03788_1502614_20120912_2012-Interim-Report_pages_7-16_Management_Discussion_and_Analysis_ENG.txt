In the first half of 2012, the global economy followed the drift of the previous year and the economy of the United States continued to recover with a tardy pace in the first half year. Recession started to demonstrate its contagious effect in European countries with economic growth diving down into the downstream channel. Naturally, the economy of China was affected and the growth rate was dampened. The Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) in the first half of 2012 was RMB22,709.8 billion, representing an increase of 7.8% compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Currently, the domestic steel output is in general featured with a modest growth and a significantly decelerated growth rate. According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China, during the period from January to June of this year, the national outputs of pig iron, crude steel and steel were 334.04 million tons, 357.2 million tons and 467.44 m illion tons respectively, representing an increase of 2.9%, 1.8% and 6.1% respectively compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. According to the data published by Bureau of Statistics of Liaoning Province, the GDP of Liaoning province was RMB1,122.81 billion in the first half of 2012, representing an increase of 9.2% compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and was higher than the national average. This year, the major target of the economic and social development in Liaoning is: an increase of 11% in the regional GDP. The outline of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan stated explicitly that the overall revitalization of Northeast Old Industrial Bases will be put forward and accordingly, Liaoning Province continued to promote industrial upgrading measures for industries including equipment manufacturing, and to construct affordable housing as well as energy and transportation facilities, which will then boost the demand for raw materials (including iron ore). Meanwhile, the Liaoni ng Provincial Land and Resources Department issued a notice, naming 2012 as the year of rectification for the whole mining industry of the province when the order of the industry will be rectified in full. Specifically, the authority will effectively manage geological exploration units to prevent unauthorized and illegal cooperation and market interference. It will also effectively stem illegal activities such as unlicensed exploration and mining, unauthorized or excessive mining, wasting or destruction of mineral resources and severe pollution to the environment. These policies have provided favourable conditions for the Group to consolidate the mineral resources in the region. In the first half of 2012, the iron ore mining of the Group was expanded, and the iron ore production volume was 2,899.2 thousand tons, representing a year-on-year increase of 37.90%; the production of iron ore concentrates reached 681 thousand tons, representing an incre ase of 8.71% as compared to corresponding period of the previous year; the Group achieved sales of iron ore concentrates of 659 thousand tons, representing a decrease of 3.08% as compared with corresponding period of the previous year, while sales revenue of iron ore concentrates was RMB603,277 thousand, representing a decrease of 19.03% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. As at 30 June 2012, the total assets of the Group reached RMB2.506 billion, representing an increase of RMB731 million as compared to RMB1.775 billion as at the beginning of this year. The average cash operation cost per ton of iron ore concentrate of each of the mines was RMB281.5, representing an increase of RMB22.2 as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year which was RMB259.3. The increase in cash operation cost was mainly due to the increase in the level of resources tax provision from RMB9 per ton of iron ore to RMB12 per ton of iron ore in February this year. Interim Report 2012 07 Affected by the domestic e conomic growth slowdown, the average selling price (excluding tax) of iron ore concentrates of the Group in the first half of 2012 decreased from RMB1,095.85 per ton in the corresponding period of the previous year to RMB915.25 per ton, representing a decrease of 16.5%. The Group will continue to increase the investment in geological exploration in our existing mines and their surroundings, with a view to obtaining iron ore resources of relatively high quality with the advantages of lower risks and costs. As at 30 June 2012, the Group owned 196 million tons of iron ore resources and 163 million tons of iron ore reserves that complied with the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee standards. The quantity of iron ore resources stored in each mine was as follows: Resources in Mid-Year (Ton) TFe (%) Inferred* Indicated* Resources in Mid-Year (Ton) TFe (%) Indicated* Inferred* +Indicated* +Inferred* The iron ore reserve level of each mine was as follows: Reserves in Mid-Year (Ton) TFe (%) Probable Ore Reserve* Probable Ore Reserve* Probable Ore Reserve* +Probable Ore Reserve* Interim Report 2012 09 In order to further improve the processing capability of raw ores and the capacity of iron ore concentrates of our existing mines, the Group had carried out a series of construction projects to upgrade and reconstruct the existing mines and construct new production facilities. In the first half of 2012, 10 applications and 45 contracts of construction projects were submitted for the approval of the Company. The Company has 4 key construction projects in 2012, which include the second phase of the technology improvement of the first processing plant of Aoniu Mine, mining works in Aoniu Mine; reconstruction and expansion of processing plant with annual capacity of 3 million tons in Maogong Mine; mining works in Benxi Mine. The progress of each major project is stated below: The first phase of the technology improvement has shown a preliminary result, and on such foundation, the second phase of the technology improvement of the first processing plant of Aoniu Mine has officially begun in February 2012. As at the end of June 2012, the civil construction of the thickening pond was completed and is currently in the stage of equipment installation, while the construction of head tank has also completed. Furthermore, the procurement and in stallation of the modified equipment for the dust-disposal system of the second processing plant of Aoniu Mine will begin. The underground mining works in Aoniu Mine has already started in the mid of April 2012. Currently, the urgent issues of power supply and motive force for underground mining and production have been settled. Before the end of June 2012, the design, tender and construction of the head tank for underground mining work, as well as the watering of the mine entrance have been accomplished. The progress of the project is basically the same as scheduled. High grading magnetic iron ore was found in Maogong Mine, and there is a huge potential to increase the ore reserves in the region. Currently, the environmental assessment, the safety assessment and the water conservation contracts for the reconstruction and expansion project of a processing plant in Maogong Mine have been entered into; the main plant construction is now proceeding as planned. The tender for the infrastructure of the crushing plant has been completed and the construction is going to be started as planned. The tenders and procurements for the key equipment have been completed. Starting from November 2011, the Benxi Mining has started the Underground Excavation Project of Mengjia Mine of Benxi Mining with Annual Capacity of 1.2 million tons, and the design of the project is mixed with the adoption of shafts and ramps. The tunneling for the ramps has been completed, while the main well towers foundation is also completed. The urban construction of the tower of the main drilling well, the equipment and shaft equipment projects were underway. Besides, the installation works of shafts of South wind shaft project were now being carried out. For the first half of 2012, the income of the Group was approximately RMB604,034 thousand, representing a decrease of RMB148,604 thousand or 19.74% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The main reason for the decrease was due to the drop in the unit selling price of the iron ore concentrates. For the first half of 2012, the cost of sales of the Group was approximately RMB211,264 thousand, representing an increase of RMB9,512 thousand or 4.71% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The main reason for the increase was due to the rise in resources tax provision standard from RMB9/ton of iron ore to RMB12/ton of iron ore in February this year. For the first half of 2012, the gross profit of the Group was approximately RMB392,770 thousand, representing a decrease of RMB158,116 thousand or 28.70% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. As compared to the same period last year, the substantial drop in gross profit margin of the Group in the first half of 2012, from 73.19% to 65.02%, was mainly due to the slipping of the average unit selling price of iron ore concentrates and the increase in the resource taxes for the iron ore. For the first half of 2012, other income of the Group was approximately RMB1,770 thousand, representing an increase of RMB1,254 thousand or 243.02% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Other income was mainly interest income, and the increase was mainly due to the abundance of capital of the Company during the Reporting Period which led to an increase in interest income during the Reporting Period. For the first half of 2012, other expenses of the Group were approximately RMB7,279 thousand, representing a decrease of RMB14,648 thousand or 66.80% as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Other expenses included loss of selling properties and plants and equipment, charity donation, expenses related to listing of the Company and other overheads. Other expenses were significantly lower than the same period in the previous year. The reason was mainly due to the inclusion of listing expenses of the Company and the losses from the disposal of fixed assets in the expense of the same period last year. During the Reporting Period, there are no such large expenses related to those two items mentioned above. For the first half of 2012, the selling and distribution expenses of the Group were approximately RMB14,089 thousand, representing an increase of RMB1,586 thousand or 12.68% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Selling and distribution expenses included transportation expenses, labour expenses and others. For the first half of 2012, the administrative expenses of the Group were approximately RMB72,124 thousand, representing an increase of RMB6,097 thousand or 9.23% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Administrative expenses included remuneration paid to the Group’s management and administrative staff, depreciation and amortization, leasing and office expenses, business development expenses, professional consultation and service expenses, taxation expens es and others. The increase in staff costs (included in cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses) from RMB37,400 thousand to RMB57,700 thousand is mainly due to the changes in social insurance due to the change of government policy. Interim Report 2012 11 For the first half of 2012, the net foreign exchange loss of the Group was approximately RMB282 thousand, whereas the net foreign exchange gain of the corresponding period in the previous year was RMB4,131 thousand. The main reason for the change is the net exchange losses generated from foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held by the Group due to changes in exchange rate. For the first half of 2012, the financing costs of the Group were approximately RMB20,998 thousand, which decreased by RMB190,593 thousand or 90.08% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Financing costs included bank borrowings interest expenses, discount interest exp enses and other financial loans interest expenses. The significant decrease of financial cost in the current period as compared to the same period in the previous year was mainly due to the interests from private borrowings that the Company bore in larger amount in the corresponding period in the previous year. During the six months ended 30 June 2012, the repayment of the private borrowings was settled by the Company, and therefore no such type of expenses was charged. For the first half of 2012, the income tax expenses of the Group was approximately RMB73,566 thousand, which decreased by RMB30,335 thousand or 29.20% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Income tax expenses included the total amount of tax currently payable and deferred tax. As at the end of the first half of 2012, according to the deducted tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and profit before tax, the effective tax rate of the Group was 26.3%, while the effective tax rate for the corresponding period of the previous year was 42.7%. The main reason for the decrease in the effective rate was that there are no overseas financial loans in the current period. Moreover, the financial costs from the private borrowings related to the listing for the same period in the previous year was incurred by the Company (a company incorporated in Cayman Islands), and therefore it is not deductible for the purpose of PRC income tax. In the first half of 2012, the losses on the changes in fair values of financial assets available for sale of the Group was approximately RMB317 thousand. Based on the reasons mentioned above, the profit and the total comprehensive income for the first half of 2012 of the Group were approximately RMB205,885 thousand, representing an increase of RMB66,301 thousand or 47.50% as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. During the six months ended 30 June 2012, the net profit margin of the Group was 34.14%, while it was 18.55% as at the corresponding period in the previous year. The growth in the net profit margin was mainly due to the fact that private borrowings costs and listing expenses were relatively higher as at the same period in the previous year when the Company was in the process of listing. Upon the successful listing of the Company, the relevant expenses decreased significantly during the six months ended 30 June 2012, which resulted in the increase of net profit margin for the current period as compared to the corresponding period last year. For the first half of 2012, the property, plant and equipment of the Group were approximately RMB570,491 thousand, representing an increase of approximately RMB133,618 thousand or 30.59% as compared to the end of the previous year. The increase was mainly due to the expansion of the production capacity through the construction of pla nts, office buildings, tailings and the procurement of machine and equipment. For the first half of 2012, the inventory of the Group was approximately RMB50,991 thousand, representing an increase of approximately RMB12,945 thousand or 34.02% as compared to the end of the previous year. The increase was mainly due to the restriction of the sales volume of Benxi Mine by contracts and agreements. For the first half of 2012, the trade receivables and the note receivables of the Group was approximately RMB287,525 thousand, representing an increase of approximately RMB54,482 thousand over the end of the previous year, of which, the increase in the notes receivables was due to the fact that the Company has sufficient cash flow during the current period and not all notes were discounted upon receipt. For the first half of 2012, the other receivables of the Group was approximately RMB250,927 thousand, which increased by approximately RMB84,446 thousand as co mpared to the end of the previous year. The increase was mainly due to the prepayment of other recoverable tax, which is related to certain resources tax and local tax policies regulated by the local tax bureau. For the first half of 2012, the trade payables and note payables of the Group was approximately RMB15,878 thousand, representing a decrease of RMB4,678 thousand or 22.76% as compared to the end of the previous year. The decrease was mainly due to the maturity for settlement of the note payables. Meanwhile, because the Company has made use of the credit period granted by the suppliers, which resulted in a slightly increase in the amount of trade payables. For the first half of 2012, the other payables of the Group was approximately RMB145,331 thousand, representing a decrease of approximately RMB36,050 thousand, or 19.87% as compared to the end of the previous year. The main reason for the decrease was the progress payment payable for properties, plants and equipment according to the contracts. Besid es, other tax payables also decreased. The summary of the Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows for the first half of 2012 was set out below. Interim Report 2012 13 The net cash inflow from the operating activities during the first half of 2012 was RMB63,186 thousand, which was mainly attributed to the profit before tax of RMB279,768 thousand, partially offset by the increase of RMB118,928 thousand in trade and other receivables. As for the current period, the income tax expenses were RMB82,211 thousand, and the cash outflow from other operating activities was RMB15,443 thousand. During the first half of 2012, the net cash outflow from investing activities amounted to RMB280,499 thousand, which mainly reflected the amount of RMB155,581 thousand used in the construction of the underground pits and the acquisition of properties, plants and equipment in Benxi Mine and Xingzhou Mine, the prepaid lease payment of RMB62,632 thousand in relation to the application of additional land use rights in the mining areas, the amount of RMB916 thousand used in the acquisition of intangible assets, purchase of loan receivabl e of RMB20,000 thousand, purchase of the available-for-sale financial assets of RMB43,140 thousand and the receipt of interest income of RMB1,770 thousand. During the first half of 2012, the net cash inflow from the financing activities was RMB585,484 thousand, which included the repayment of bank loans of RMB100,000 thousand and the payment of the shareholders’ dividends of RMB32,166 thousand, offset by the proceeds of RMB720,000 thousand from new bank borrowings. For the year ended 31 December 2011 and the first half of 2012, the bank borrowings of the Group were approximately RMB250,000 thousand and RMB870,000 thousand, respectively. In addition to the information disclosed above or otherwise in this interim report, the Group has no outstanding mortgage, pledge, debentures or other loan capital issued or agreed to be issued, bank overdrafts, borrowing, liabilities under acceptance or other similar liabilities, hire purchase and finance lease commitments, or any guarantees or o ther material contingent liabilities. The Directors have confirmed that, save for the information disclosed above, there has been no material changes in the indebtedness and contingent liabilities of the Group since 31 December 2011. The gearing ratio of the Group increased from 36.4% in 31 December 2011 to 48.2% in 30 June 2012, which is calculated by dividing the total liabilities by the total assets. The interest rate risk in the fair value of the Group mainly relates to the bank borrowings. The bank borrowings of the Group are usually due within one year, and therefore, the interest rate risk in its fair value is relatively remote. There is no interest rate hedging policy currently prevailing in the Company. Nevertheless, the management of the Group monitors the interest rate risk, and may consider taking hedging measures as needed on the occurrence of significant interest rate risks. The businesses of the Group are located in China, an d its major operating transactions are dominated in RMB. In addition to the liabilities arising from the financing loans dominated in US dollars and certain professional expenses payable dominated in HK dollars and US dollars mainly arising from the listing of the Company, most of the assets and liabilities of the Group are dominated in RMB. Since RMB is not freely convertible, the risk that the Chinese government may take measures to interfere the exchange rates, may bring effects to the Group’s net asset value, profit and the dividends declared to the extent that such dividends are subject to foreign exchange, and we have no hedging measures against such exchange risks. The bank borrowings of the Group are secured by the mining rights certificates and, notes and equity interest in Benxi Mine. Meanwhile, Ms. Yang Min offered a guarantee for the Group on it’s bank borrowings of RMB140,000 thousand. As of 30 June 2012, the aggregate net carrying value of the assets used as securities amounted to RMB285,000 thousand, and the aggregate net carrying value of the notes used as securities amounted to RMB80,000 thousand. As of 30 June 2012, the Group had no material contingent liabilities. As at 30 June 2012, the Group had future capital expenditure in respect of acquisition of property, plant and equipment contracted for but not provided for of approximately RMB147.9 million (30 June 2011: RMB34.3 million). Such increase is mainly due to the increase in the expenditure in the exploration, development of mines and mining. As of 30 June 2012, the Group had no material acquisitions and disposals of assets and merger issue. The Company was listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 30 September 2011. The net proceeds raised from the listing of the Company excluding underwriting expenses and other expenses payable rel ated to its initial public offering (“IPO”) amounted to approximately HK$807.3 million. As of 30 June 2012, the IPO proceeds available for application and already applied by the Company are set out as follows: Net Proceeds for the Available for Already Million HK$ Million HK$ The exploration, development and mining production activities expenses of the Group was approximately RMB472,644 thousand in the corresponding period in 2011. It dropped to approximately RMB222,822 thousand in the first half of 2012. The expenses for the first half of 2012 mainly included: (i) expenses on properties, plants and equipments of RMB155,709 thousand; (ii) land lease payments of RMB66,612 thousand pa id in order to acquire the using right of mining lands; and (iii) expenses of RMB501 thousand generated from the acquisition of the mining rights certificates. Interim Report 2012 15 Under the influence of the slowdown of economic growth in China and the sluggish growth in fixed assets investment, the crude steel output of the first half of 2012 merely recorded an increase of 1.8% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, while the rate of growth decreased 7.8% year-on-year. Yet, to consider the absolute output volume, the crude steel output of China for the first half of 2012 reached 357 million tons, representing 46.6% of the global crude steel output, which remains as the largest crude steel production country worldwide. At the same time, as at the end of 2011, the urbanization rate in China reached 51.27%. However, this figure shows that China still has huge potential in terms of urbanization. Accordingly, the rate of growth of crude steel output in China may not reach a high level, but the aggregate output will still maintains at a high level, which will in turn be the continuous support for the future demand for the iron ores market. In recent years, the State has promulgated a series of policies to encourage the development of mining industry which covers the iron ore segment. Such policies included encouraging mining companies to conduct “integrated exploration” and carry out mining activities on temporary lands under the pilot scheme in Liaoning province. The Group has fully utilized such policies to expand its exploration areas and mining capabilities. In addition, the redevelopment and the new construction projects of the processing plant of Aoniu Mine and Maogong Mine under the Group will be completed progressively in the first half of 2013. Upon completion, the processing capability of these two mines alone will reach 6 million tons per year which in turn will significantly increase the iron ore processing capacity of the Group.

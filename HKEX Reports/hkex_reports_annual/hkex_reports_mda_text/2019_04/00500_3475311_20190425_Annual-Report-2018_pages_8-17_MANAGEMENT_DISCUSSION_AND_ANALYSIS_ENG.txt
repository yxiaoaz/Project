The revenue growth was mainly due to the Group’s expansion in logistics business in Shanghai. For 2018, the Group reported an operating loss of HK$259,248,000, a 17% increase over 2017’s reported operating loss of HK$221,448,000. The increase over the same period of 2017 was mainly due to increase in employee benefit expenses and rental expenses due to the expansion of footprints along the Belt and Road regions. Reported results for 2018 also included non-recurring income, expenses, impairment and provisions, such as a gain on the disposal of available-for- sale financial assets and substantial impairment charges against goodwill, other intangibles, property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale, which had a combined net negative effect on the reporting operating loss by HK$13,382,000 (2017: HK$43,726,000) on a net basis. 00B1903041 AR.indb 7 00B1903041 AR.indb 7 Frontier Services Group Limited (13.61) cents (15.84) cents Net asset value per share (excluding non-controlling interests) The basic loss per share was HK$0.1361 for 2018, relative to basic loss per share of HK$0.1584 for 2017. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had total assets of HK$1,505,983,000, marking a 70% increase versus the same figure for 2017 due to issue of new shares and exercise of share options by a director of the Company, offset by impairment made against intangibles, property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale. The current ratio and total liabilities-to-total assets ratio at year end 2018 were 5.39 and 0.21, respectively. The Group’s total liabilities-to-total assets ratio and the current ratio were improved principally because of the increase in cash and bank balances and trade receivables and repayment of bank and other loans during 2018. While the pronounced decrease in the Company’s share price over 2018, closing at HK$1.24 at year- end and the increase in Group’s net assets were the primary factors for the decrease in the price-to-book ratio. 00B1903041 AR.indb 8 00B1903041 AR.indb 8 Annual Report 2018 Consolidated revenue for 2018 was HK$866,748,000, marking growth of 20% on an annual basis. The expansion in logistics business managed in Shanghai was the primary driver of the annual growth in total revenue. More specifically, logistics business in Shanghai contributed HK$189,545,000 (2017: HK$24,328,000) revenue to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018. As a result, and in line with past years, aviation and logistics (“AL”) business accounted for 98% (2017: 97%) of the Group’s 2018 revenue. The Group’s remaining legacy unit, financial market information (“FMI”) business, produced HK$17,472,000 of revenue for the full-year 2018, a decline of 12% versus 2017 as a result of market demand slackened. Other intangibles of HK$4,087,000 associated with the Group’s operating businesses were impaired in 2018. The decision to take this impairment against an AL subsidiary, namely Phoenix Aviation Limited (“PAL”), was reached after a careful internal review of those business units and discussion among the Group’s senior management. Impairment made due to the scale down of its maintenance business and a decline in the franchise’s core air ambulance business within a generally more competitive marketplace in east and central Africa, which has had a secondary negative effect on pricing. In the future, the Group will continue to monitor the carrying value other intangibles in accordance with its accounting practices. Provision for Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and The Group recorded HK$8,318,000 provision for impairment loss against the aircraft fleet for the year ended 31 December 2018. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is measured periodically against the resale market value for comparable assets. The market for aviation assets is cyclical, with substantial changes in resale pricing common over time. Consequently, the Group impaired specific aircraft within its fleet to better reflect the likely value achievable in a resale scenario as at 31 December 2018, and will closely monitor if an impairment indicator is identified. 00B1903041 AR.indb 9 00B1903041 AR.indb 9 Frontier Services Group Limited Aviation and Logistics Business (“AL Business”) With continuous growth in the Group’s AL Business in 2018, HK$849,276,000 of revenue was reported from operating subsidiaries mainly from Africa, southern Europe and Mainland China. The organic growth in logistics business in Shanghai was fundamental catalyst in AL Business revenue growth comparing 2017. The Group will continue to implement cost containment measures to increase profitability and potential value in the AL Business. Transit Freight Forwarding (Pty) Ltd (“TFF”), a South African based warehouse and logistics company, generated HK$373,745,000 of revenue in 2018. This 3% revenue growth reflected the increase in freight charges to its customers by TFF in 2018 and was in line with management expectations. With new management team on board, TFF conducted a new thorough cost analysis and will develop a specialty logistics division to further increase its operational efficiency and profitability. Frontier Logistics (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Logistics”), a PRC based logistics company, generated HK$189,545,000 of revenue in 2018.

With expected expansion through managing more profitable and new aircraft and the provision of freight services, we are optimistic about the operations and results of Maleth in 2019. PAL, a Kenyan aviation company based in Nairobi, reported a 19% decline in revenue compared to 2017. Downward price pressure and keen competition in the charter and air ambulance services in Africa deeply impacted the overall results of PAL. Improved performance is expected from PAL upon the implementation of cost containment measures and new business development in 2019. With tremendous efforts paid on developing security and insurance business along the Belt and Road regions during the past few years, the Group has a breakthrough in revenue in 2018. We expect the security and insurance business will have obvious growth and contribute positive impact to the Group in 2019. The Group’s AL Business loss increased by 21% to HK$196,737,000 comparing 2017. The increase was mainly due to expansion of offices, as well as the increase in initial set up expenses, along the Belt and Road roadmap. With the launch of various cost containment measures and rollout of various projects, positive impacts are expected from AL Business in 2019.

Annual Report 2018 During the year under review, the Group together with its joint venture were principally engaged in the (i) railway construction and operations; and (ii) shipping and logistics businesses. The Group started its investment in railway construction and operations in July 2009 through the acquisition of 100% equity interest in Gofar Holdings Limited which indirectly holds a 62.5% equity interest in each of (Chengde Zunxiao Railway Limited*) (“Zunxiao Company”) and (Chengde Kuanping Railway Limited*) (“Kuanping Company”), and a 51% equity interest in (Tangshan Tangcheng Railway Transportation Company Limited*) (“Tangcheng Company”) (collectively the “Railway Companies”). The business scope of the Railway Companies consists of the construction and operation of a 121.7 kilometer single track railway (the “Zunxiao Railway”) with 12 stations connecting two major municipalities in the Hebei Province ( ), namely Tangshan City ( ) and Chengde City ( ), in the PRC. The construction of the Zunxiao Railway was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010. However, as disclosed in the Company’s previous financial reports, the construction progress had been obstructed significantly owing to contingent circumstances. With a view to resuming the construction of the Zunxiao Railway, the management of the Company has visited the local governments to promote the settlement of the overlaid mine, express the Company’s strong determination to the construction of the Zunxiao Railway, catch on the latest local economic conditions and policies and discussed with other shareholders of the Zunxiao Railway in respect of funding for the resumption of construction works. As disclosed by the Company previously, the outstanding issue which caused the prolonged delay of the construction related mainly to the assessment of the scope of compensation payable to the overlaid mine owner (the “Mine Owner”). Upon various negotiations with the Mine Owner, the Group has achieved positive progress in the settlement of the overlaid mine issue. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Group has entered into a joint appointment letter with the Mine Owner, pursuant to which, both parties have agreed to engage an independent valuer to assess the reserve of the iron ore, assets and value of the overlaid mine. Such assessment shall become a basis for determining the compensation amount payable to the Mine Owner in the future. As at the date of this Annual Report, the preliminary assessment of the iron ore reserve of the mine conducted by the independent valuer was completed. The management of the Company is in discussion with the Mine Owner about the compensation amount of the overlaid mine. The Group started its shipping business in May 2010 through the joint venture company (the “JV Company” and together with its subsidiary, the “JV Group”) and its own vessel owning and chartering business in November 2013 through acquisition of a Handysize bulk carrier, namely, MV Asia Energy. In early 2018, two additional Handysize bulk carriers, MV Clipper Selo and MV Clipper Panorama, were acquired by the Group. The impact of the financial crisis on the global shipping market has gradually weakened. Although there was fluctuation in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) which measures the demand for shipping capacity versus the supply of dry bulk, the shipping market during 2018 has recovered significantly from its record lows in February 2016 and charter rates for dry bulk vessels were maintained at a profitable level. The JV Group currently owns two Handysize vessels with carrying capacity of approximately 35,000 DWT each operating in the China domestic shipping market. Both JV vessels were under full employment throughout the year under review except for a short period of drydocking and the JV Group recorded revenue of approximately HK$80,416,000 (2017: approximately HK$79,360,000), representing an increase of approximately 1% as compared to 2017. The Group’s share of loss from the JV Group was approximately HK$24,754,000 (2017: a share of profit of approximately HK$9,718,000). Pursuant to the joint venture agreement entered into on 1 December 2009 (as amended by a supplemental agreement dated 1 December 2009) (collectively, the “JV Agreement”) among the parties to the JV Agreement, a total of four vessels are to be acquired. However, due to the continuing poor shipping market conditions for the past few years, the JV Group has not made further acquisition of the remaining two vessels as planned. The Group discussed with its joint venture partner and reached a mutual understanding to withhold enforcement of or otherwise discharge the Group’s financial obligations under the JV Agreement to acquire the two remaining vessels until the Group’s financial position has improved and the shipping market recovers to a more sustainable level which justifies the further acquisition. The Group currently operates a fleet of three dry bulk carriers trading worldwide. The total carrying capacity of the Group’s dry bulk fleet is approximately 92,000 DWT (2017: approximately 28,000 DWT), representing an increase of approximately 229%. The Company successfully acquired and took deliveries of MV Clipper Selo and MV Clipper Panorama in April 2018 and both vessels were then chartered out and started generating revenue immediately after their deliveries. MV Asia Energy was under full employment throughout the year under review, whilst MV Clipper Selo and MV Clipper Panorama have also been under full employment since their deliveries in April 2018 except a short period of drydocking. For the year of 2018, the Group recorded a revenue of approximately HK$50,669,000 (2017: approximately HK$15,797,000), representing an increase of approximately 221% as compared to the year of 2017. The gross profit was approximately HK$11,496,000 (2017: approximately HK$903,000), representing an increase of approximately 1173% as compared to the year of 2017. The increase in both the revenue and gross profit were due to the increase in charter rate and the additional contribution made by the two newly acquired vessels immediately after their deliveries. The performance of the Group’s own vessels was satisfactory and has made positive contributions to the Group. Annual Report 2018 During the first half of 2018, the State Council promulgated the Three-year Action Plan to Make the Skies Blue Again ( ) (hereinafter referred to as the “Action Plan”). The Action Plan specified the fundamental objectives, major tasks and supporting measures for the air pollution control of the forthcoming three years. The transportation structure will be optimized according to the Action Plan, with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and its surrounding areas as focus. In principle, highways are no longer available for the transportation of large-burden materials used in new construction, reconstruction and extension projects. The optimization on the cargo transportation structure mainly focuses on the shifting of highway transportation to railway transportation for the commodities cargo. According to the Action Plan, it is anticipated that by 2020, the volume of railway freight will increase by 30% nationwide as compared with that of 2017, while the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and its surrounding areas will increase by 40%. The construction of special railway lines for iron and steel and other key enterprises will be accelerated by fully deploying the special railway line capacity in place and substantially increasing the proportional percentage of railway transportation. It is expected that the proportional percentage of railway transportation will be more than 50% in the major areas by 2020. The management of the Company considered that the above new policies will facilitate the restoration of the railway construction and bring more opportunities to railway transportation. However, on 29 January 2019, the Board received a report from its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, namely China Railway Logistic Holdings Limited (“China Railway”), which is the majority shareholder of the Railway Companies. The report from China Railway enclosed a copy of an urgent letter of request dated 28 January 2019 (“Letter of Request”) jointly issued by the Railway Companies. In their Letter of Request, the Railway Companies requested China Railway to pay in February 2019 the proportional contribution to the anticipated increase of the respective registered capital of the Railway Companies in an aggregate amount of RMB417 million. The Board has carefully assessed the available resources of the Company and come to the view that the Company does not currently have sufficient resources to satisfy the abovementioned request of the Railway Companies within the prescribed timeframe. For this reason, the Board believes that there may be a need to restructure the equity interest the Company indirectly in the Railway Companies (the “Possible Restructuring”) with the objective to preserve the interests of the Company in the Zunxiao Railway to the utmost extent. Although as at the date of this Annual Report, the structure and scale of the Possible Restructuring are yet to be developed and determined, if it were to materialize, the Possible Restructuring may involve the Company disposing of its indirect equity interest in each of the Railway Companies. The management of the Company has been taking and will continue to take proactive, appropriate and timely steps to explore and examine various feasible and suitable options for the Possible Restructuring to meet the requests under the Letter of Request. China Dry Bulk Shipping Market: the PRC government has been focusing more attention to environmental protection, especially on reducing the pollution caused by road transportation. The introduction of the Chinese emission rules which aim at strengthening the control of emission reduction and the new national transportation policies of Road-to-Rail and Road-to-Sea to support the environmental protection will have a positive impact on China shipping market. International Dry Bulk Shipping Market: the international dry bulk shipping sector is under-going a multi-year upcycle. The market fundamental looks good and dry bulk demand is benefiting from China’s commodity imports. However, with the escalating trade war during the year, the shipping market has certainly been affected. The dry bulk shipping market has already been affected by the steel and aluminium tariffs and the shipping market could possibly be hit again if and when further tariffs come into force. The effect of the trade war has triggered uncertainties and could unsettle the much recovered shipping market. Despite the uncertainties caused by the trade war and its potential adverse impact on the shipping market, the management of the Company expects that the Group’s shipping and logistics business will not be significantly affected in the year 2019 as all three vessels are on charter contracts which will run until the end of the year 2019 or beyond. The Group will continuously seek for suitable investment opportunities to expand its fleet size by acquiring vessels of similar or other carrying capacity. For the year ended 31 December 2018, the revenue of the Group was approximately HK$50,669,000, representing an increase of approximately 221% compared with the revenue of approximately HK$15,797,000 for the year ended 31 December 2017. The loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 was approximately HK$168,775,000, representing an increase of approximately 73% compared with the loss after tax of approximately HK$97,403,000 for the year ended 31 December The increase in loss for the year under review as compared to the loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in share based payment resulted from the grant of share options under the Company’s share option scheme amounting to approximately HK$20,858,000 (2017: Nil); (ii) the increase in the share of loss of a joint venture of approximately HK$24,754,000 (2017: a share of profit of approximately HK$9,718,000); (iii) the adverse fair value change of derivative financial instruments based on the valuation of the GIC Convertible Bonds issued by the Company of approximately HK$12,939,000 (2017: Nil); and (iv) the increase in finance costs incurred for the Group’s operations by approximately HK$11,226,000, from approximately HK$61,377,000 in 2017 to approximately HK$72,603,000 in 2018. The basic and diluted loss per share of the Company for the year under review was HK5.91 cents (2017: HK4.23 cents). Annual Report 2018 The Group is mainly financed by various borrowings, shareholders’ equity and internally generated cash flows. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had bank and cash balances of approximately HK$18,456,000 (2017: approximately HK$5,968,000). As at 31 December 2018, the Group had guaranteed bank loans of approximately HK$922,151,000 (2017: approximately HK$1,086,228,000) repayable within one year. The effective interest rate for the year was 4.9% (2017: 4.9%) per annum. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had unsecured other borrowings of approximately HK$725,632,000 (2017: approximately HK$571,047,000) repayable within one year or on demand. Other borrowings of approximately HK$34,524,000 (2017: approximately HK$40,795,000) are interest bearing at 1.0% to 8.0% (2017: 1.5% to 8.0%) per annum while the remaining balances of approximately HK$691,108,000 (2017: approximately HK$530,252,000) are interest-free. The gearing ratio of the Group as at 31 December 2018, which is calculated as net debt (i.e total liabilities less bank balance and cash) divided by adjusted capital (net debt less total deficits), was approximately 110% (2017: approximately 111%). During the year, convertible notes in the principal amount of HK$3,500,000 were converted into 30,734,663 shares of the Company (the “Shares”) and no new Shares were issued upon the exercise of share options granted under the Company’s share option schemes. On 23 February 2018, a total of 923,361,034 Shares were allotted and issued pursuant to a placing agreement dated 30 November 2017. As at 31 December 2018, there were 2,479,876,223 Shares in issue (2017: 1,525,780,526 Shares). Golden Concord Holdings Limited (“GCL”) had provided a guarantee to a bank in respect of the bank borrowings facilities, in aggregate, up to approximately RMB1,033 million (equivalent to approximately HK$1,179 million), granted to certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company in the PRC. In return for GCL’s guarantee, the Group provided a counter-indemnity to indemnify GCL to the extent of the percentage of equity interest held by the Group in each of the subsidiaries of up to approximately RMB602 million (equivalent to approximately HK$687 million) and a share mortgage of its shares in China Railway, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and equity and asset pledges of China Railway’s subsidiaries in favour of GCL. As at 31 December 2018, the outstanding bank borrowings amounted to approximately RMB807,990,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$922,151,000) and therefore, according to the Group’s percentage equity interest holdings in the subsidiaries, the amount indemnified by the Group under the counter-indemnity in favour of GCL would be up to approximately RMB470 million (equivalent to approximately HK$536 million). As at 31 December 2018, the Group had capital commitment of approximately HK$259,538,000 (31 December 2017: approximately HK$279,879,000). The Group’s assets, liabilities and transactions are mainly denominated either in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars or Renminbi. As the exchange rate of the US dollars to Hong Kong dollars is relatively stable due to the Hong Kong dollars is pegged to the US dollars, the Directors consider that the Group’s currency exchange risk is within acceptable range. Therefore, no hedging devices or other alternatives have been implemented. The Group recognises that capital risk is a key risk area that the Group exposed to. The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to maintain a balance between the higher shareholder returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and makes adjustment to the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions. For the financial risks such as are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and equity price risk arising from movements in its own equity share price and the fair value changes of its trading securities, the Group currently does not have a hedging policy. The management of the Company will monitor the situation and will consider to adopt hedging policy should the need arise. Furthermore, the Group’s financial management policies and practices help to manage the financial risks. Further details about these financial risks are set out in Note 36 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The main source of income of the Group was derived from its shipping and logistics businesses. Therefore, the Group is exposed to shipping market fluctuation risk where any drastic downturn in shipping market will have an adverse effect on the Group’s revenue. As a way of minimising the effect of shipping market fluctuation on the Group’s revenue, the management of the Company is constantly monitoring the shipping market condition with a view to signing longer-term hire contract as and when the hire rate rises to an acceptable level. As the Group’s fleet of vessels trade worldwide, it is required that the operation of the vessels shall comply with the requirements of international conventions as well as various rules and regulations of different port states. In order to minimize the impact of any non-compliance on the Group’s business operation, the management of the Company liaises closely with ship management company and officers onboard to ensure the strict compliance with all the requirements. In cases where there are changes made to the regulatory policies, in particular, those policies related to environmental issues, the management of the Company will ensure that the ship management company and officers on board are fully informed.

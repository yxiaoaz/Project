With the exception of export sales and the imported equipment which are transacted in U.S. dollars and Euros, the Group’s domestic revenue and expense are denominated in Renminbi. Therefore, the Board is of the view that the Group’s operating cash flow and liquidity during the Year are not subject to significant foreign exchange rate risk. The Group has not used any foreign currency derivatives to hedge against the exposure in foreign exchange. The Group’s bank borrowings denominated in Euro and U.S. dollars as at the year ended 31 December 2018 amounted to approximately EUR34,290,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB269,084,000) and USD63,009,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB423,443,000) respectively. Therefore, the Group may be exposed to certain foreign exchange rate risk. CHINA HIGH SPEED TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT GROUP CO., LTD. The net gains of foreign exchange recorded by the Group during the Year was approximately RMB25,621,000 (2017: net losses of RMB29,944,000), including gains from our export business denominated in U.S. dollars due to the fluctuation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars during the Year. The Group will actively manage the net amount of foreign currency assets and liabilities by formulating foreign currency control measures and strategies, with a view to reducing its exposures to foreign exchange risk for the coming year. During the Year, the loans of the Group are mainly sourced from bank borrowings and corporate bonds.

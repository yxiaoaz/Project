Management’s Discussion The Group is principally engaged in generation and sales of electricity in Mainland China, including investment, development, operation and management of coal-fired power, hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic power plants. Its businesses are located in the major power grid regions of China. In 2018, the national total electricity consumption in China rose by 8.5% as compared with the previous year, reaching a record high over the past seven years. The national power generation recorded an increase of 8.4% as compared with the previous year, among which, coal-fired power increased by 7.3% as compared with the previous year; and hydropower increased by 3.2% as compared with the previous year. As of the end of 2018, the national power generation installed capacity increased by 6.5% and the growth rate slowed down as compared with the previous year. Overall, despite further slowdown in newly installed capacity, the national electricity demand grew steadily with balanced supply and demand in general. In 2018, the Group achieved significant progress in transformation and development strategy by further increasing the proportion of clean energy assets and accelerating its transformation into a clean energy enterprise. During the year under review, the Group completed the acquisitions of Guangxi Company, Shandong Company, Anhui Company, Hubei Company and Shouxian Company, where all their assets are high-quality clean energy projects. As of the end of 2018, the Group’s attributable installed capacity of clean energy reached 6,487.9MW, representing an increase of 38.16% as compared with the previous year. During the year under review, the Group won the bid for and commenced the construction of four photovoltaic power projects with an installed capacity of 100MW each for Datong Phase II in Shanxi Province, the PRC. All of these projects are expected to commence operation in 2019. As national “Top-Runner” photovoltaic power demonstration projects recognized by the National Energy Administration of the PRC, they are of strategic significance to the Group. In 2018, the Group recorded a substantial improvement in its operating results. The profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company was RMB1,098,355,000, representing a significant increase of 38.11% as compared with the previous year. It was mainly the impact of consolidating the results of the newly acquired clean energy project companies, in particular from the hydropower generating units in Guangxi, the PRC; the substantial increase in contributions from photovoltaic power and wind power; and the increase in both electricity sales and average on- grid tariff of coal-fired power that turned around to profit during the year under review. Basic earnings per share was approximately RMB0.11. As at 31 December 2018, net assets per share (excluding non-controlling interests) was RMB3.05. The details of power generation and electricity sold of the Group are set out as follows: In 2018, the total electricity sold by the Group amounted to 70,964,796MWh, representing an increase of 10.79% as compared with the previous year. In respect of coal-fired power, due to the increased demand for electricity in the provinces where the Group’s coal-fired power plants are located and rising sales volume obtained by individual coal-fired power plants through market bidding, the electricity sold significantly grew 11.96%. Under the Group’s vigorous efforts in promoting the development of clean energy, both electricity sale of wind power and photovoltaic power were significantly up by 122.57% and 145.34% year-on-year respectively. As for the hydropower segment, the Group experienced a significant decline in terms of power generation due to low rainfall in Hunan Province, the PRC where some of the Group’s hydropower plants are located, which offset part of the positive impact of consolidating the result of hydropower from Guangxi Company during the year. The Group also performed well in gaining incentive electricity from local governments. In recognition of the fulfilment of certain specific targets of the government in respect of environmental protection, heat supply capacity of the generating units and productivity of some power generating units, the amount of various incentive electricity available for production accumulatively obtained by the Group increased significantly during the year as compared with the previous year. The details of electricity sales of the Group’s main associates and joint ventures are set out as follows: In order to strongly support the existing environmental policies promulgated by the PRC government, the Group has carried out in-depth exploration in the heat supply potentials in various regions, strengthened the development of user base and promoted the construction of centralized heating pipe networks in recent years, thereby achieving satisfactory results in energy efficiency upgrade and development of heat supply market. In 2018, the total heat sold by the Group (including an associate and two joint ventures) was 18,480,340GJ, representing an increase of 1,022,329GJ or 5.86% as compared with the previous year. In 2018, an associate of the Group completed the optimization and expansion of the heating system of four generating units, and the maximum heat supply of each generating unit has increased by 150%, greatly improving its heating capacity. The Group has played an active role in the market-oriented reform of national power industry, analyzed the opportunities therein and participated in direct power supply transactions (including competitive bidding for on- grid electricity sales) with a view to securing market share. In 2018, a number of coal-fired power plants and clean energy power plants of the Group participated in direct power supply transactions, the electricity sold through direct power supply transactions amounted to 19,913,594MWh and 3,360,047MWh respectively, together accounting for approximately 32.80% of the Group’s total electricity sold. As direct power supply is a way of open market trading of electricity, the tariffs will therefore vary with supply and demand in the electricity market. In 2018, for those coal-fired power and hydropower plants of the Group which participated in direct power supply transactions, their average post-tax tariffs were at a discount of approximately 8.02% and 1.03% respectively compared with the respective average post-tax on-grid tariffs approved by the PRC government (including ultra-low emission tariff). The direct power supply tariff discount for coal-fired power was slightly lower than that of 2017. In 2018, the Group’s average on-grid tariffs as compared with the previous year were as follows: coal-fired power was RMB324.57/MWh, representing an increase of RMB11.43/MWh; hydropower was RMB280.86/MWh, representing a decrease of RMB3.76/MWh; photovoltaic power was RMB677.98/MWh, representing a decrease of RMB46.00/MWh. The year-on-year increase in average on-grid tariff of coal-fired power of the Group was mainly due to the rise of the relevant on-grid tariffs commencing from 1 July 2017. The increase in average on-grid tariff of wind power was mainly due to the higher average tariff resulting from some newly operating wind power plants and the consolidation of new wind power project companies with higher average on-grid tariffs. The decrease in average on-grid tariff of photovoltaic power was mainly due to the reductions of on-grid tariffs by the National Development and Reform Commission for those photovoltaic power projects that commenced operation after 1 January 2018 and 31 May 2018 respectively. The Group will continue to closely monitor the development of environmental protection policies of the PRC government and strengthen the research on green energy tariff policies in order to actively seek for more green energy subsidies and in turn increase revenue. In 2018, the average unit fuel cost of the Group’s coal-fired power business was RMB215.62/MWh, representing an increase of 3.07% from that of RMB209.19/MWh of the previous year. The unit fuel cost in 2017 increased by 35.48% as compared with the prior year, indicating a significantly stabilized unit fuel cost in 2018. In 2018, the net coal consumption rate of the Group was 302.41g/kWh, representing a decrease of 1.82g/kWh as compared with the previous year. The existing coal-fired power generating units of the Group are mostly environmental friendly power generating units with large capacity and high parameter. These units have achieved substantial effect in energy saving and emission reduction, which have helped maintaining the net coal consumption rate at a low level, and outperformed the national standard coal consumption rate of power supply. In 2018, the average utilization hours of the Group’s coal-fired power generating units was 4,585 hours, representing an increase of 481 hours as compared with the previous year. Due to the fact that the PRC government has been committed to regulating the development of coal-fired power in an orderly manner in recent years, the growth of newly-installed capacity of coal-fired power across China slowed down and the national total electricity consumption increased while the average utilization hours of coal-fired power of the Group also picked up. The average utilization hours of hydropower generating units was 3,148 hours, representing a decrease of 405 hours as compared with the previous year, mainly attributable to the decrease in power generation as a result of low rainfall in the river basins where some of the hydropower plants of the Group are located. The average utilization hours of wind power generating units was 1,967 hours, representing an increase of 114 hours as compared with the previous year. The average utilization hours of photovoltaic power stations was 1,398 hours, representing a decrease of 132 hours as compared with the previous year. In 2018, the net profit of the Group amounted to RMB1,637,185,000, representing an increase of RMB356,478,000 as compared with the previous year. During the year under review, the Group continued to promote the development of clean energy. With the commencement of operation of various new power generating units and the consolidation of newly acquired project companies, profit contribution from wind power and photovoltaic power segments grew dramatically. The coal-fired power segment realized a turnaround in profit attributing to the increase in both electricity sold and average on-grid tariff as compared with the previous year. In 2018, the net profit and loss of each business segment and their respective ratio of contribution to the total net profit were as follows: net profit from hydropower was RMB849,881,000 (51.91%, 2017: 113.20%); net profit from wind power was RMB215,612,000 (13.17%, 2017: 2.32%); net profit from photovoltaic power was RMB406,843,000 (24.85%, 2017: 15.10%); unallocated net loss was RMB352,486,000 (-21.53%, 2017 (restated): -15.64%). As compared with 2017, the changes in net profit were mainly due to the following factors: Revenue from coal-fired power increased by RMB2,293,959,000, which was attributable to the increase in sales and rise of the average on-grid tariff of coal-fired power as compared with the previous year; Revenue from wind power and photovoltaic power increased by RMB1,146,191,000 in aggregate due to the commencement of commercial operation of various new power generating units and the consolidation of newly acquired project companies; Revenue from hydropower decreased by RMB231,335,000 as a result of lower hydropower electricity sales and the decrease in average on-grid tariff of hydropower as compared with the previous year; Fuel costs increased by RMB1,470,717,000 as a result of the increase in unit fuel cost of RMB6.43/MWh and the increase in fuel consumption attributable to the growth in sales of coal-fired power during the year; Depreciation of plant and equipment and staff cost increased by RMB677,984,000 in aggregate as a result of Finance costs increased by RMB722,651,000 as a result of the increase in total debts level and overall interest rates. The revenue of the Group was mainly derived from sales of electricity to regional and provincial power grid companies and provision of power generation and related services while the Group recognized its revenue when the Group satisfied a performance obligation. In 2018, the Group recorded a revenue of RMB23,175,626,000, representing an increase of 16.07% as compared with RMB19,966,811,000 of the previous year. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the year-on-year increase of RMB2,293,959,000 in revenue from coal-fired power as a result of the combined effect of the year-on-year increases of 11.96% and 3.65% in its sales and average on-grid tariff respectively. The revenue of wind power and photovoltaic power have also recorded significant increases due to the commencement of commercial operation of various new power generating units and the consolidation of newly acquired project companies. The reportable segments identified by the Group are now the “Generation and sales of coal-fired electricity”, “Generation and sales of hydropower electricity”, “Generation and sales of wind power electricity”, and “Generation and sales of photovoltaic power electricity”. Operating costs of the Group mainly consist of fuel costs for coal-fired power generation, repair and maintenance expenses for power generating units and facilities, depreciation and amortization, staff costs, consumables and other operating expenses. In 2018, the operating costs of the Group amounted to RMB19,421,256,000, representing a rise of 13.17% as compared with RMB17,161,571,000 of the previous year. Operating costs increased mainly due to the rising fuel cost, and the increase in depreciation and staff costs resulting from the commencement of operation of various new power generating units and the consolidation of newly acquired project companies. As the fuel cost constituted the majority of the total operating costs, control of fuel cost has always been an important task for coal-fired power generating enterprises. During the year under review, amid the significant growth in demand for coal and lower-than-expected production, in its best effort to curb the increase of fuel cost, the Group continued to enhance its coal purchase management and increase the scale of its centralized procurement through a wholly-owned subsidiary as the Group’s procurement platform. It has strengthened the management of long-term coal contracts and control over the fulfilment of annual contracts to increase the realization rate of long-term coal contracts. By way of strengthening market analysis and implementation of staggered procurement, the Group adjusted its coal inventory level in response to the market changes in a timely manner as well as commenced coal reservation for winter in advance. It has explored various new coal supply channels and maintained active communication with coal enterprises to improve its bargaining power and reduce the fuel cost. In 2018, the Group’s operating profit was RMB4,414,341,000, representing an increase of 42.01% as compared with the operating profit of RMB3,108,454,000 of the previous year. The increase in operating profit was mainly due to the substantial increase in gross profit of the coal-fired power business attributable to the increase in the electricity sales and the rise of average on-grid tariff of coal-fired power, and the profit contributions from the continuous expansion of the wind power and photovoltaic power businesses. In 2018, the finance costs of the Group amounted to RMB2,578,254,000, representing an increase of 38.94% as compared with RMB1,855,603,000 of the previous year. Among which, the interest expenses increased due to the rise of debts level and lending interest rates. Exchange gains decreased drastically due to the decline in the exchange rate of RMB against USD. Challenged by the interest rate hike of borrowings and capital cost for infrastructure investment, the Group put more efforts to improve the efficiency of capital utilization, expedited financing among various business units internally and simplified the procedures of internal fund transfer to control the amount and actual interest rate of borrowings. In 2018, the share of profits of associates was RMB114,461,000, representing a decrease of RMB108,169,000 or 48.59% as compared with the share of profits of RMB222,630,000 of the previous year. The decrease in profits was mainly due to the decrease in both electricity sold and average on-grid tariff from some coal-fired power plants. In order to maintain profitability, Changshu Power Plant (the principal associate of the Group engaging in coal- fired power generation) completed the upgrade and expansion of the heat supply system of four generating units during the year under review. The maximum heat supply of each unit increased by 150%, which significantly boosted heat supply capacity. In 2018, the share of loss of joint ventures was RMB6,446,000, representing a decrease in profits of RMB51,189,000 or 114.41% as compared with the share of profits of RMB44,743,000 of the previous year. The decrease in profits was mainly due to the relocation of some major heat consumers in the industrial park where Xintang Power Plant (the principal joint venture of the Group engaging in coal-fired power generation and heat supply) is located, and the rise in coal price which led to an increase in fuel costs, resulting in a significant reduction in net profit. In 2018, income tax expense of the Group was RMB432,763,000, representing an increase of RMB152,833,000 as compared with RMB279,930,000 of the previous year. For the year ended 31 December 2018, certain subsidiaries of the Group were either exempted from PRC Enterprise Income Tax or entitled to the preferential tax rates of 7.5%, 10%, 12.5% or 15% (2017: 7.5%, 12.5% or 15%). In 2018, the basic and diluted earnings per share for profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company were RMB0.11 (2017: RMB0.10) and RMB0.11 (2017: RMB0.10) respectively. At the Board meeting held on 21 March 2019, the Board recommended the payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of RMB0.11 (equivalent to HK$0.1292 at the exchange rate announced by the PBOC on 21 March 2019) per ordinary share (2017: RMB0.081 (equivalent to HK$0.1006) per ordinary share), totaling RMB1,078,757,000 (equivalent to HK$1,267,050,000) (2017: RMB794,358,000 (equivalent to HK$986,573,000)), which is based on 9,806,886,321 shares (2017: 9,806,886,321 shares) in issue on 21 March 2019 (2017: 22 March 2018). The Group announced a revised dividend policy in January 2019. According to the policy, the Company may declare and distribute annual cash dividends to its shareholders in an amount representing not less than 50% (previously 25%) of the profit attributable to owners of the Company in any financial year, subject to the criteria set out in the policy. In addition, the Company intends to maintain a relatively stable dividend per share for the next three years starting from 2018 at a level not lower than that in 2017 in principle barring unforeseeable circumstance in the Group’s operating environment and results. As at 31 December 2018, the attributable installed capacity of the Group’s power plant reached 19,731.6MW, representing an increase of 2,680MW as compared with the previous year. Among which, the attributable installed capacity of clean energy, including hydropower, wind power, photovoltaic power and natural gas power, was 6,487.9MW in total, accounting for approximately 32.88% of the total attributable installed capacity and representing an increase of 5.34 percentage points as compared with the previous year. The significant increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of various companies principally engaging in clean energy power generation during the year, including Guangxi Company, Shandong Company, Anhui Company and Hubei Company. The attributable installed capacity of the Group’s existing natural gas power was wholly held by Shanghai Power. During the year under review, the Group continued to promote its development of clean energy. By increasing the proportion of clean energy in its asset portfolio through construction and acquisition on an on-going basis, the Group is further approaching the goal of being a resource-saving and environmental friendly enterprise. In 2018, the Group’s attributable installed capacity from new power plants of wind power and photovoltaic power that commenced commercial operation were 229.9MW and 95.7MW respectively. The Group’s new power generating units that commenced commercial operation during the year included: Type of Installed Capacity Interest Attributable Installed Capacity Timeline for Cogeneration of November 2018 December 2018 July 2018 July 2018 September 2018 December 2018 December 2018 December 2018 December 2018 January 2018 April 2018 April 2018 August 2018 September 2018 November 2018 December 2018 December 2018 Note: Apart from the above additional power generating units, as compared to the previous year, the Group recorded a net increase in attributable installed capacity of 2,680MW after taking into account the followings: (i) the attributable installed capacity of 5MW from Phase 3 of a photovoltaic power station of Changshu Power Plant, an associate, commencing commercial operation; (ii) the attributable installed capacity of 1,824.5MW in aggregate from the acquisition of new project companies ; (iii) the decrease in attributable installed capacity of 557.2MW due to changes in equity interests in certain power plants; (iv) the decrease in attributable installed capacity of 7.9MW due to the disposal of a hydropower plant of Wu Ling Power; and (v) the changes in the installed capacity of Shanghai Power and Sichuan Energy Investment. As at 31 December 2018, the attributable installed capacity of the projects under construction was 3,629.2MW, among which, the attributable installed capacity of coal-fired power and clean energy segments were 1,650.2MW and 1,979MW respectively. The clean energy segments accounted for 54.53% in aggregate. In response to the national supply-side reform in the power industry, the Group actively stepped up its efforts in developing clean energy projects, and made appropriate adjustments to the development and construction of coal-fired power projects and controlled its capital expenditure. For coal-fired power projects under construction, the Group has obtained approval from the local governments in the PRC, progressed according to the government’s stipulated construction schedule, and matched with the planning of electricity demand in places where the project users are located. The Group will continue to expedite the implementation and development of other clean energy projects by seizing various development opportunities, making proper preparation and capturing quality resources. It will develop offshore wind power projects and other clean energy projects in Guangdong, Shandong and other coastal regions, and closely monitor the development trend of natural gas power to identify and implement profitable projects steadily. Currently, the total installed capacity of new projects of the Group at a preliminary development stage (including projects with applications submitted to the PRC government for approvals) is approximately 5,700MW, among which, the total installed capacity of clean energy projects (including natural gas power projects) is approximately 3,700MW, which is mainly located in areas with development potentials, including Guangxi, Hunan and Shandong. On 31 May 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the National Energy Administration jointly published the “Notice on Photovoltaic Power-related Matters 2018” ( 2018 ), pursuant to which, construction of general photovoltaic power stations was not arranged for 2018, instead, the government would support photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects, promote construction of “Top Runner” photovoltaic power bases and speed up ending the photovoltaic power subsidy policies. In response to the policy changes, the Group will continue to pay attention to relevant policy development and prudently invest in photovoltaic power projects in the future in order to cope with the new operating environment. As at 31 December 2018, the carrying amount of equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income was RMB3,083,174,000, accounting for 2.47% of total assets, including listed equity securities of RMB2,942,667,000 and unlisted equity investments of RMB140,507,000. Listed equity securities represented the equity interests in Shanghai Power held by the Group. As at 31 December 2018, the Group held 13.88% of the issued share capital of Shanghai Power, the A shares of which are listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange. Fair value of such equity interests decreased by 11.38% as compared with RMB3,320,491,000 as at 31 December 2017. In August 2018, Shanghai Power acquired assets from its holding company by way of issue of consideration shares, which led to an increase in its registered capital. As a result, the Group’s shareholding in Shanghai Power diluted from 15.08% to 13.88%. Unlisted equity investments represented the Group’s investment in equity of some unlisted companies principally engaging in financial services, coal production, water supply and electricity trading services respectively. Upon the application of HKFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, the Group’s unlisted equity investments are measured at fair value, instead of measuring at cost less impairment as previously required. As at 31 December 2018, the aggregate fair value of unlisted equity investments owned by the Group was RMB159,706,000 (including an unlisted equity investment in PRC as part of a disposal group classified as held for sale), representing a decrease of 8.97% from RMB175,442,000 measured at cost less impairment as at 31 December 2017. In October 2017, the Company entered into Acquisition Agreements with CPI Holding and SPIC respectively, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of equity interest in various companies principally engaging in clean energy power generation, including Guangdong Company (excluding CPI Qian Zhan Gang Dian Company Limited), Guangxi Company, China Power (Sihui) Cogeneration Company Limited, Anhui Company, Hubei Company, Shandong Company and Shouxian Company. Upon completion of the transactions, the Company would further hold a higher proportion of clean energy assets including large-scale hydropower, wind power, natural gas power, and centralized and distributed photovoltaic power generation projects, which would enhance the Group’s assets and business coverage and improve its overall market competitiveness. For details, please refer to the announcement of the Company dated 9 October 2017.

For details, please refer to the announcement of the Company dated 22 November Save as disclosed above, the Group did not have any other material acquisition or disposal during the year under review. As at 31 December 2018, cash and cash equivalents of the Group were RMB1,853,044,000 (31 December 2017: RMB4,577,786,000). Current assets amounted to RMB8,793,641,000 (31 December 2017: RMB9,319,946,000), current liabilities amounted to RMB26,012,138,000 (31 December 2017: RMB28,821,524,000) and current ratio was 0.34 (31 December 2017: 0.32). In 2016, the Company entered into a 3-year financial services framework agreement with SPIC Financial. According to the agreement, the deposit services to be provided by SPIC Financial to the Group would be on normal commercial terms or better (similar to or more favorable than those offered by other major commercial banks in China for the provision of comparable services), and the annual cap in respect of the maximum daily balance of deposit (including accrued interests) placed by the Group with SPIC Financial should not exceed RMB3 billion during the term of the agreement. During the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018, the Group deposited funds with SPIC Financial at the average deposit rate higher than PBOC’s benchmark interest rates for saving deposits and not lower than the agreed interest rates for saving deposits provided by major commercial banks in China for the same period. For the year ended 31 December 2018, the maximum amount of daily deposit placed by the Group with SPIC Financial was approximately RMB2.98 billion. In order to ensure that the relevant business is in compliance with the terms of the financial services framework agreement, the Company had designated personnel to monitor the funds deposited with SPIC Financial, performed daily real- time inquiries on the funds deposited with SPIC Financial, and collected deposit rates offered by major domestic commercial banks for comparison with the deposit rates offered by SPIC Financial on a monthly basis. In addition to the deposit offers as agreed in the above agreements, SPIC Financial also provides internal fund management platform, cross-border fund allocation platform and other financial services to the Group through its own financial resources, such as the business information system and cross-border fund allocation channels. Such platforms enable the real-time monitoring of account balances as well as income and expenditure, thereby safeguarding against funding risks. At the same time, they facilitate flexible and efficient fund allocation across borders, which gives rise to more flexible capital flow at home and aboard, broadens financing channels for domestic subsidiaries and reduces uncertainties in inbound and outbound fund flows due to changes in foreign exchange regulations. During the year under review, the Group recorded a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (including cash and cash equivalents as part of a disposal group classified as held for sale) of RMB2,723,522,000 (2017: net increase of RMB2,829,558,000). For the year ended 31 December 2018: net cash generated from operating activities amounted to RMB2,784,456,000 (2017: RMB3,132,196,000). net cash used in investing activities amounted to RMB12,184,593,000 (2017: RMB6,284,724,000), which mainly represented the payment for the acquisition of Guangxi Company as well as cash outflow of capital expenditure on the Group’s property, plant and equipment and prepayments for construction of power plants. net cash generated from financing activities amounted to RMB6,676,615,000 (2017: RMB5,982,086,000). The increase in cash inflow as compared with last year was mainly attributable to the new capital injections from non-controlling shareholders of some subsidiaries. The financial resources of the Group were mainly derived from cash inflow from operating activities, borrowings from banks and related parties, project financing, and issuance of medium-term notes and super short-term commercial papers. The net proceeds from the rights issue in 2017 in the amount of RMB3,734,047,000 was used in settling the consideration for the acquisition of Guangxi Company of RMB3,594,652,000 in 2018. The remaining proceeds from the rights issue of approximately RMB139 million will be used to settle the consideration payables for the designated acquisitions in 2019. For the relevant details of the designated acquisitions, please refer to the announcement of the Company dated 9 October 2017. As at 31 December 2018, total debts of the Group amounted to RMB64,917,976,000 (31 December 2017: RMB51,640,030,000). All debts of the Group are denominated in RMB, Japanese Yen (“JPY”) or United States Dollars (“USD”). As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s gearing ratio, calculated as net debt (being total debts less cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (being total equity plus net debt), was approximately 60% (31 December 2017: approximately 56%). The Group’s gearing ratio remained stable. As at 31 December 2018, the amount of borrowings granted by SPIC Financial was approximately RMB2.15 billion (31 December 2017: approximately RMB1.36 billion). The details of the Group’s debt as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 are set out as follows: The above debts were repayable as follows: Among the above debts, approximately RMB24,297,951,000 (31 December 2017: approximately RMB18,160,768,000) are subject to fixed interest rates, and the remaining debts denominated in RMB are subject to adjustment based on the relevant rules of the PBOC and bearing interest rates ranged from 4.17% to 5.23% (2017: ranged from 3.92% to 5.10%) per annum. In September 2018, the Company received confirmation in relation to the acceptance of its application for the issuance of medium-term notes in the PRC in the aggregate principal amount of RMB2 billion, with an effective registration period of 2 years and to be issued in tranches within the effective registration period. On 12 October 2018, the Company completed the issuance of the 2018-first-tranche of the medium-term note in a principal amount of RMB2 billion, at the interest rate of 4.15% per annum and with a term of three years. The proceeds were fully used for repayment of bank borrowings. In March and April 2018, Wu Ling Power, a subsidiary of the Company, issued super short-term commercial papers in the PRC of RMB300,000,000 with an interest rate of 4.93% per annum and of RMB500,000,000 with an interest rate of 4.78% per annum, respectively, both with maturity periods of 180 days. The proceeds were fully used for repayment of bank borrowings and the relevant super short-term commercial papers were fully redeemed by the end of 2018. In 2018, the capital expenditure of the Group was RMB11,563,878,000 (2017: RMB8,501,931,000). In particular, the capital expenditure for clean energy segments (hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic power) was RMB7,672,993,000 (2017: RMB4,675,024,000), which was mainly applied for the construction of new power plants and power stations; whereas the capital expenditure for coal-fired power segment was RMB3,730,637,000 (2017: RMB3,666,377,000), which was mainly applied for the construction of new coal-fired power generating units and technical upgrade for the existing power generating units. These expenditures were mainly funded by project financing, funds generated from business operations and borrowings from related parties. As at 31 December 2018, the Group pledged certain property, plant and equipment and prepaid lease payments with a net book value of RMB533,096,000 (31 December 2017: RMB561,001,000) to certain related parties to secure borrowings from related parties (31 December 2017: bank borrowings) in the amount of RMB227,820,000 (31 December 2017: RMB257,820,000). In addition, certain bank borrowings, borrowings from related parties and obligations under finance leases totaling RMB20,301,015,000 (including bank borrowings as part of a disposal group classified as held for sale) (31 December 2017: RMB13,267,104,000) were secured by the rights on accounts receivable of certain subsidiaries of the Group. The accounts receivable secured under these borrowings amounted to RMB1,580,203,000 (including accounts receivable as part of a disposal group classified as held for sale) (31 December 2017: RMB1,125,299,000). As at 31 December 2018, the Group had no material contingent liabilities. The Group has implemented all-rounded risk management and has established a systematic and comprehensive risk management mechanism and internal control system. It also has a Risk Management Committee which is accountable to the Board and responsible for assisting the Board in providing leadership, direction and oversight with regard to the overall risk appetite and tolerance and risk management framework of the Group, including risk policies, process and controls. The Group also has an internal audit department in place for execution and implementation of risk management measures. The Group principally operates its businesses in Mainland China with most of its transactions settled in RMB. Apart from certain bank and other borrowings as well as cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in RMB. The Group held borrowings denominated in JPY and USD during the year. Higher volatility of RMB exchange rate against USD and JPY increases the exchange rate risks of the Group, thus affecting its financial position and operating results. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s borrowings denominated in foreign currencies amounted to RMB3,322,940,000 (31 December 2017: RMB3,864,606,000). The Group will continue to keep track on the exchange rate movements and, if necessary, take responsive measures to avoid excessive foreign exchange rate risks. With the Group’s efforts to strengthen its development of all kinds of new power projects, funding adequacy will have an increasing impact on the Group’s operations and development. The financing market is affected by a number of factors such as the liquidity of the lending market and the economic environment, which in turn may also affect the effectiveness and costs of the Group’s borrowing. The Group has always leveraged its capability of accessing the Mainland China and overseas markets to optimize its funding sources, increase the credit facilities and lower its financing costs. Various cost-saving and efficiency enhancement initiatives have also been adopted in the Group’s business management to lower administrative and operating expenses. Moreover, the financial services framework agreement with SPIC Financial also helps to reduce funding risks. In early 2018, SPIC Financial provided convenient and strong capital support to the Group when the challenging liquidity environment of the PRC gave rise to financing difficulties and high financing cost for enterprises. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had sufficient available unutilized financing facilities amounting to RMB34,328,213,000. At the beginning of each year, the management reports to the Board on the working capital budget for the year and estimates the credit facilities and facilities reserves required for the year to ensure the Group has adequate financial resources to support the continued operation and development of projects in the foreseeable future. The management will also review the situation regularly to take contingency measures. Coal demand and supply are affected by various factors including economic development, government policies, transportation and weather. Regional and time factors may also expose the supply and price of the coal market to volatility risk. In view of the various risks in the coal market, the Group has actively communicated and coordinated with major coal enterprises, increased centralized procurement, managed coal procurement through long-term procurement contracts and strengthened the monitoring of performance and execution of such contracts, enhanced inventory management and expanded various new channels for coal supply, thereby securing coal supply and controlling the procurement price. The Company will continue to closely monitor the changes in government policy as well as the domestic and overseas coal markets, based on which, it will adopt corresponding measures for effective risk aversion. The share of market trading electricity will increase as the State advances the reform of the power market. Due to intense market competition, electricity is traded at a discount to the benchmark electricity tariff price in market transactions, which puts downward pressure on the average on-grid tariffs of the Group. The Group will actively optimize customer resources and target high-quality and trustworthy clients to combat adverse price competitions. It will also strengthen synergy between power generating enterprises so as to avoid malicious competitions on the power generating side. A reasonable scheme for tariff pricing will be formulated to prevent tariff transactions with low marginal revenue. Apart from the above, the Group will monitor the changes in government tariff policy and strive to obtain more tariff subsidies. The rapid adoption of Internet technology has resulted in more frequent and severe cyber-attacks around the world. The Group is exposed to cyber-attacks on the power monitoring system, which would undermine production safety. Meanwhile, a shared financial service centre of the Group has commenced operation for the centralized management of various financial data, and any attacks on it may cause disruption of data transmission or even data loss, which will, in turn, affect business operation. Thus, these risks could materially and adversely affect the operation and reputation of the Group. In view of the risks of possible attacks on the power monitoring system, the Group pushed forward the pilot technology and prevention projects, and continuously required all units to enhance promotion and education, maintain strict compliance with the safety management system and safeguard information security. As for the newly commenced shared financial service centre, the system has fully identified and taken corresponding measures against various risks since its inception, which included the adoption of dual power supply, the high- power uninterruptible power system with mutual hot backup function, comprehensive fire safety equipment and other environmental safety measures. The center is also equipped with adequate network safety equipment and the capability of on-site backup, off-site disaster recovery and segmentation of internal and external networks. The Group has a response mechanism in place for emergencies, which is under inspection and rectification on a regular basis to assess changes in relevant risks. The Group has always been placing a great emphasis on environmental protection from the perspective of sustainable corporate development, vigorously promoting energy saving and emission reduction, conscientiously fulfilling its social responsibilities and actively responding to global climate change. In active response to the policy of “Action Plan of the Upgrade and Renovation of Energy Saving and Emission Reduction of Coal-fired Units (2014–2020) ( (2014–2020 ))” promulgated by the PRC government, the Group has strengthened the environmental control and rectification measures for its coal-fired power generating units. Currently, more than 95% of the operating coal-fired power generating units have met the standards of ultra-low-emission. In 2018, the operational ratio of desulphurization facilities for the coal-fired power generating units of the Group was 100% (2017: 100%), and the efficiency ratio of desulphurization was 99.20% (2017: 98.42%); the operational ratio of denitration facilities reached 100% (2017: 100%) and the efficiency ratio of denitration reached 91.02% (2017: 92.98%). During the year under review, the environmental protection indicators for coal-fired power generating units were further improved: the emission rate of sulphur dioxide (SO2) at 0.056g/kWh, representing a decrease of 0.007g/kWh as compared with the previous year; the emission rate of nitrogen oxide (NOx) at 0.097g/kWh, representing an increase of 0.002g/kWh as the emission rate of flue gas and dusts at 0.008g/kWh, representing a decrease of 0.005g/kWh as compared with the previous year. To prevent pollutants from exceeding the emission standards at source, the Group has also incorporated concepts and requirements of social responsibilities in the management of suppliers, and clearly stipulated that the materials must meet the standards of the relevant national environmental protection laws while signing material purchase contracts. During the year under review, all the power plants over which the Group has operational control complied with the relevant PRC environmental protection regulations. No fines or charges were imposed due to violation of regulations. The Group’s employees are equipped with labor tools and labor protection gears that are compliant with safety standards, while a variety of safety knowledge, safety skills training, as well as emergency training and drills have been arranged, as the Group continues to improve its conditions for operations in strict compliance with the Work Safety Law of the People’s Republic of China and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases and other laws and regulations relating to safety and hygiene. In order to further enhance its core competitiveness and promote sustainable development, the Group has established the accredited Quality, Occupational Health and Safety, and Environment (QHSE) “three standards” management system in line with international standards, which plays an important role in enhancing management quality and promoting transformational development. In 2018, no material accident in relation to employees, facilities and environmental protection occurred in the Group. During the year under review, all operating power plants over which the Group has operational control complied with the relevant PRC production safety regulations. No fines or charges were imposed due to violation of regulations. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had a total of 10,269 (31 December 2017: 9,780) full-time employees. The increase in the number of employees was due to the consolidation of the newly-acquired project companies. The Group has put great emphasis on the establishment of the performance evaluation as well as rewarding and punishment mechanism for all employees. It determines the emoluments of its directors and employees based on their respective performance, working experience, duties and market rates. The Group has also implemented an incentive policy linking emoluments with performance. The Group has attached importance to the learning and training of employees and to the communication between employees of different positions. It has improve the professional and technical capabilities and overall competence of its employees on an on-going basis, so as to satisfy the needs of its expanding businesses. During the year under review, all business units over which the Group has operational controls complied with the local labor laws. No fines or charges were imposed due to violation of regulations. We regard customers and suppliers as very important stakeholders. The Group has been maintaining good communication and establishing a long-term and stable cooperative relationship with them. During the year ended 31 December 2018, there were no significant disputes with customers and suppliers. The Group is an independent power producer. Because of the special nature of electricity production and sales, its major customers are regional and provincial power grid companies, through which it sells the electricity generated by its power plants to power users and settles the transactions. The Group has been maintaining long- term and good customer relationships with the power grid companies in various locations where its power plants locate. During the year under review, the aggregate turnover attributable to the Group’s five largest customers (regional power grid companies) accounted for 78.39% of the Group’s total turnover. In recent years, with the PRC government moving forward the system reform in the power industry, the Group has promoted the customer-centered philosophy and actively participated in market-oriented direct electricity transactions. It has also established and invested in electricity sales and distribution companies, and developed distributed and integrated intelligent energy projects. In the meantime, the Group has made direct connections with power users and maintained good cooperation with them by developing and providing value-added services. Due to the gradual advancement of market-oriented reform in the power industry, the share of open market transactions, such as direct power supply, will further increase. The Group’s major suppliers are coal production and sales enterprises, while its coal-fired power plants purchase the majority of coal from neighboring coal production enterprises primarily under long-term contracts. The Group has been maintaining long-term and good relationships with major suppliers in order to ensure efficient coal procurement. During the year under review, the aggregate purchases from the Group’s five largest suppliers (for production materials like coal and consumables) accounted for approximately 75.42% of the Group’s total purchases. The Group will continue to explore different procurement channels to ensure the stability of coal supply. The Group strives to establish fair, just and stable mid-to-long-term cooperation with suppliers, strictly fulfills the contractual agreements, respects and treats each supplier equally. It has formulated a stringent and standardized supplier selection and management system, established a supplier review team and conducted strict reviews according to the integrity, quality assurance, punctuality of supply, price reasonableness, etc., so as to select more competent and reputable suppliers to jointly maintain a healthy and orderly market environment. The Group also incorporates concepts and requirements of social responsibilities in supplier management, and clearly stipulates that materials must meet the relevant national environmental protection laws and standards while signing purchase contracts, in order to prevent pollutants from exceeding the emission standards at source. In 2019, in respect of the macro-economy, the Chinese government will place emphasis on driving high-quality development by taking the major task of “making up for shortcomings” in the supply-side reform, with focuses on key business sectors and greater efforts in improving any weaknesses in major fields with a view to making investments in a precise and effective manner. According to the central government, it will continue to deepen market-oriented reforms, further loosen entry barriers to the market and encourage foreign investors to engage in the high-quality development of China, at the same time consistently implementing its proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy. It is estimated that the Chinese economy will maintain its growth within a reasonable range. In terms of electricity supply and demand, the China Electricity Council predicted that the year-on-year growth in total national electricity consumption would slow down steadily to approximately 5.5% for 2019. At the same time, the national electricity supply and demand would reach equilibrium in general, and certain regions would suffer from insufficient supply temporarily. In order to seize opportunities amid intensifying competitions, the Group will continue to strengthen the development and operation of the renewable energy business, enhance the marketing of direct electricity sales and seek to increase electricity and heat transmission. In terms of reform progress, the market-oriented reform of the power industry in China will proceed and the reform of state-owned enterprises will keep advancing. With the aim of optimizing the management structure and operating mechanism of state-owned enterprises, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council promulgated and implemented the “Work Program of ‘Double Hundred Action’ in State-owned Enterprise Reform” ( ) so as to increase the vitality and efficiency of state-owned enterprises. As of now, the Group has established a special group to closely follow up on the issue. The Group considers, management enhancement, revenue boost and expenditure reduction are the main focuses in improving operating results amid a relatively stable macroeconomic and power supply and demand environment, while adaptation to reforms is the key to more efficient operation under the context of comprehensively advancing reforms. With the target of becoming one of the leading clean energy enterprises globally, it is also the Group’s long-term strategy to achieve high-quality growth by staying committed to the development of clean energy and comprehensive intelligent energy. The priorities of the Group for 2019 include the followings: Enhance operation management for higher efficiency on all counts. The Group will make greater efforts in the marketing of electricity sales, through which it will further increase direct trade of electricity in the more market-oriented environment. Moreover, it will implement strict control over fuel cost and cost of capital, and improve the labor productivity of staff simultaneously. Control the debt leverage and prevent operational risks. The Group will control capital expenditures and strengthen the cash flow. It will ensure a sound capital structure by introducing strategic investors at the subsidiary level as appropriate and keeping the debt ratio at a reasonable level. Maintain the established strategy and insist on transformational development. The Group will continue the transformation towards a clean energy enterprise and secure the development of top-notch clean energy projects, which will create advantages in scale and quality for clean energy operation. Besides, it will dispose of some of its equity interests and assets of coal-fired power subsidiaries, lower the proportion of coal-fired power installed capacity and optimize the installed capacity structure. It will expand the scope of comprehensive intelligent energy services, steadily promote project development and optimize corporate governance on an ongoing basis. Leveraging on the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises in China, the Group will improve internal systems and mechanisms, and nurture a high-caliber workforce.

During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group was principally engaged in the research and development, manufacturing, trading and selling of extracts, flavors and fragrances.

In 2018, China’s growth slowed gradually, with gross domestic product expanding by 6.8% on the year in the first quarter, by 6.7% in the second quarter and by 6.5% in the third quarter, as the government cut back on infrastructure spending to try to reduce debt at the local level. Signs of slowdown included the weakening of industrial production, profits and revenues. Foreign trade flows would lose some momentum following the escalation of trade tensions. The trade war between China and the United States had adverse effect on the economies of both countries and even had much sway over the economies of other countries in the world. Despite the slowdown of economic growth in China, the Company had strived to strengthen its business by enhancing the product quality and creating more innovative products in the flavor and fragrances industries. During the year ended 31 December 2018, through its five business segments, the total revenue of the Group amounted to approximately RMB1,146.4 million (2017: RMB1,089.2 million), representing a slight increase of 5.3% when compared to last year.

Recently the Group’s Healthcare Products Segment has collected approximately 60% of certain trade receivable from its top ten major customers while our Flavors Enhancers Segment has collected more than 44% of the trade receivable from its top ten major customers successfully. These two business segments have contributed more than 70% of the total revenue of the Group as at 31 December 2018 in aggregate. The Group strives to adopt stringent credit control over the trade receivable and this can enhance the cash position of the Group and improves our liquidity and current ratio from time to time.

The food flavors segment recorded a revenue of approximately RMB144.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: RMB138.7 million), representing a mild increase of 4.1%.

The fine fragrances segment recorded a revenue of approximately RMB142.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: RMB136.5 million), representing a mild increase of 4.7%. The constant increase in the sales of the fine fragrance segment was due to the improvement of living standard and higher expectation on the household environment and personal care products by the customers in the PRC. The revenue of e-cigarettes (which comprised disposable e-cigarettes and rechargeable e-cigarettes) and its accessories surged to approximately RMB230.2 million during the year ended 31 December 2018, representing a significant increase of 15.3% from approximately RMB199.7 million of last year. The increase was due to the introduction of certain new products in this segment. The revenue of this segment was in the amount of approximately RMB26.3 million, representing a slight decrease of 5.7% from approximately RMB27.9 million last year. The slight decrease was due to the change of tenants which created a transition period of no rental income.

Such improvement was mainly attributable to the reduction of the sales commission of the Group during the year under review. Administrative expenses amounted to approximately RMB274.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: RMB257.3 million) representing approximately 24.0% to revenue of the year (23.6% to revenue in 2017). The increase in these expenses was mainly attributable to the increase in the professional fee, employee benefit expenses, consulting expenses and official expenses of the Group during the year under review. The Group applies the HKFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses for all trade receivables. This resulted in an increase of the loss allowance by a further RMB551,000 for trade receivables during the current reporting period. Other income amounted to approximately RMB12.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: 26.3 million). The decrease was mainly due to the reduction of the government subsidizes granted to certain PRC subsidiaries of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2018. Other gains — net amounted to approximately 52.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: 40.4 million).

Finance costs — net amounted to approximately RMB103.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (2017: RMB113.0 million) which mainly consisted of the interest expenses on additional borrowings obtained in the year. Due to the decrease in the exchange rate of Renminbi at the year ended 31 December 2018, there was a decrease in realized exchange losses and caused the decrease in the Finance cost net. Net profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 amounted to approximately RMB146.3 million (2017: RMB156.1 million), representing a mild decrease of 6.3% when compared to last year.

Net profit margin for the year also decreased to approximately 12.8% (2017: 14.3%).

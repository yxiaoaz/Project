Our net profit after tax (NPAT) for the year ended 31 December 2020 was US$510 million, representing a decrease of 27.4% compared with US$702 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The decrease in profit for the year was mainly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our airline customers and buyers of our aircraft. This resulted in global travel restrictions during 2020 that had a material adverse impact on the airline industry. Despite this, total revenues and other income rose by 3.9% to over US$2 billion. Excluding the one-off loss on investment in equity instruments, total costs and expenses rose by 17.6%, largely due to impairment of aircraft and an increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Our selected financial data and changes to our consolidated statement of profit or loss are set out below: Other income: (67.0) Depreciation of property, plant (15.2) Loss on investment in equity (27.3) (26.8) (27.4) Our total revenues and other income increased by 3.9% to US$2.1 billion from US$2.0 billion in 2019, primarily due to an increase in lease rental income and interest and fee income as described below. Our lease rental income increased by 4.7% to US$1.8 billion compared with US$1.7 billion in 2019. The main driver of the increase in lease rental income was the growth of our fleet to 352 aircraft on operating lease compared with 317 aircraft as at 31 December 2019. During the year, we added 47 aircraft on operating leases and sold 12 aircraft. The lease rental yield1 for aircraft subject to operating leases was 10.0% for 2020 compared with 10.7% for 2019 mainly due to delivery of aircraft in the last quarter of 2020 which did not generate revenue for the full year. Our interest and fee income rose significantly to US$177 million in 2020 from US$99 million in 2019. This growth was primarily due to an increase in fees from pre-delivery payment transactions and interest income on new finance leases for six aircraft. The lease rental yield2 for aircraft on leases classified as finance leases in accordance with IFRS 16 (Leases) was 6.2% for 2020. Net gain on sale of aircraft decreased by 67% to US$44 million in 2020 compared with US$134 million in 2019 mainly due to having sold 12 aircraft in 2020 compared with 28 aircraft sold in 2019. Incidental income was mainly related to amounts paid by manufacturers based on mutual agreements, tax rebates, income arising from the termination of leases with certain airline customers and government wage subsidies under a jobs support scheme. Excluding loss on investment in equity instruments, the increase in costs and expenses to US$1,412 million in 2020 from US$1,201 million in 2019 was primarily due to impairment of aircraft and an increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment which are described below. The loss on equity instruments of US$79 million was due to realised loss on the sale of the shares of Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) that were issued to the Company in 2020 in connection with the financial restructuring of NAS under which certain present and future receivables under aircraft leases were converted into equity. Lease rental yield for operating leases is defined as operating lease rental income divided by the average of aircraft net book value (including aircraft held for sale). Lease rental yield for finance leases is defined as the average effective interest rate per annum on finance lease receivables as at 31 December 2020. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased by 10.9% to US$676 million in 2020 compared with US$610 million in 2019, mainly due to a 12.5% increase in the net book value of aircraft assets which increased to US$18.9 billion as at 31 December 2020 from US$16.8 billion as at 31 December 2019. Impairment of aircraft, where the estimated recoverable value of certain aircraft was lower than the relevant aircraft’s net book value, was US$109 million in 2020. Finance expenses increased by 6.3% to US$455 million in 2020 from US$428 million in 2019 mainly due to an increase in total indebtedness to US$16.8 billion as at 31 December 2020 from US$13.5 billion as at 31 December 2019, partially offset by lower cost of debt of 3.2% per annum in 2020 from 3.6% in 2019. Staff costs decreased by 15.2% to US$68 million in 2020 from US$80 million in 2019 mainly due to the lower provisions for variable cash bonuses in 2020 compared with 2019 based on the Company’s performance. Impairment losses on financial assets of US$43 million in 2020 increased by 75.0% from US$25 million in 2019 stemming from increased receivables from lessees exceeding the security deposits held by us under those leases. Other operating costs and expenses mainly comprise amortisation of deferred debt issue costs, taxes (other than income tax expense), repossession and transition costs, and general and administration costs. The increase in these costs to US$61 million in 2020 from US$59 million in 2019 was mainly due to increased provision for costs in relation to the repossession of aircraft. Profit before income tax decreased by 27.3% to US$563 million in 2020 from US$775 million in 2019. Our pre-tax profit margin decreased to 27.4% in 2020 from 39.2% in 2019. Income tax expense decreased by 26.8% to US$53 million in 2020 from US$73 million in 2019, mainly in line with the decrease in profit before income tax. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 9.4%, similar to 2019. As a result of the foregoing, our profit after tax for the year decreased by 27.4% to US$510 million in 2020 from US$702 million in 2019. Our total assets increased by 19.2% to US$23.6 billion as at 31 December 2020 from US$19.8 billion as at 31 December 2019. Our total equity increased by 4.3% to US$4.8 billion as at 31 December 2020 compared with 31 December 2019. Our selected financial data and changes to our consolidated statement of financial position are set out below: (2.0) (9.4) (69.5) We had property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale of US$22.2 billion as at 31 December 2020, which increased by 14.7% from US$19.3 billion as at 31 December 2019 due to the net addition of 35 aircraft in 2020. Aircraft constituted the largest component, amounting to US$18.9 billion and US$16.8 billion as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively, representing 85.1% and 86.7% of our total property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale as at the same dates. Aircraft pre-delivery payments constituted 14.9% and 13.2% of our total property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively. There were no assets held for sale as at 31 December 2020 while assets amounting to US$0.3 billion were held for sale as at 31 December 2019. Finance lease receivables of US$685 million as at 31 December 2020 (2019: nil) were in respect of six aircraft subject to leases contracted in 2020 that were classified as finance leases in accordance with IFRS 16 (Leases). Trade receivables, net of allowance for impairment losses on financial assets, increased to US$155 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$18 million as at 31 December 2019 mainly due to delayed payments by certain airline customers as at 31 December 2020. The gross trade receivables as at 31 December 2020 were US$223 million comprising US$104 million which was contractually deferred by mutual agreement and not overdue, and which is generally interest bearing, and US$119 million which was past due. An amount of US$68 million, representing the overdue receivables in excess of security deposits, were provided for as impairment losses on financial assets. Our cash and short-term deposits, which were mainly denominated in US Dollar, increased to US$408 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$287 million as at 31 December 2019. The increase in cash and short-term deposits was mainly due to the total net cash inflows from operating activities, financing activities, and proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, having been greater than the cash outflows from capital expenditure during 2020. Our assets and liabilities with respect to derivative financial instruments represent unrealised gains and losses, respectively, which were recognised in the hedging reserve in equity or profit or loss, on the cross-currency interest rate swap and interest rate swap contracts that we contracted as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 respectively. Under assets, our derivative financial instruments increased to US$11 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$2 million as at 31 December 2019. Under liabilities, our derivative financial instruments decreased to US$218 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$222 million as at 31 December 2019. The movements in derivative financial assets and liabilities were primarily due to changes in marked-to-market values of the derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates. Due to the further downward movements in USD interest rates in 2020, the unrealised loss in the hedging reserve increased to US$171 million as at 31 December 2020 compared with US$101 million as at 31 December 2019. Other assets increased to US$149 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$129 million as at 31 December 2019 mainly due to a corporate tax receivable from the US federal tax authority. The tax receivable was in relation to a tax refund which arises due to the carry back of net operating losses (tax losses) which can be offset against prior years’ taxable income under the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Our trade and other payables decreased by 9.4% to US$187 million as at 31 December 2020 compared with US$206 million as at 31 December 2019, primarily due to a decrease in staff cost accruals. Our deferred income tax liabilities increased by 39.1% to US$465 million as at 31 December 2020 from US$334 million as at 31 December 2019 mainly due to increased taxable temporary differences in depreciation of aircraft. Our loans and borrowings increased by 25.5% to US$16.7 billion as at 31 December 2020 from US$13.3 billion as at 31 December 2019 to finance the increase in capital expenditure. The increase in loans and borrowings included the issuance of US$2.9 billion of notes under our Global Medium Term Note Program, the drawing down of US$1.7 billion in term loans and an increase in the utilisation of our revolving credit facilities of US$505 million during 2020. An amount of US$1.8 billion in term loans and medium term notes was repaid as part of regular loan repayment and loan prepayments in 2020. Total equity increased by 4.3% to US$4.8 billion as at 31 December 2020 compared with US$4.6 billion as at 31 December 2019. The increase in total equity was attributable to profit for the year which was partially offset by payment of dividends amounting to US$246 million and an increase in unrealised losses in hedging reflected in hedging reserve as explained under “Derivative financial instruments”. Other than corporate guarantees for certain loans extended to our subsidiary companies and for obligations under certain lease agreements entered into by our subsidiary companies as set out in Note 40 to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, the Company had no material contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2020. Our primary sources of liquidity comprise cash generated from aircraft leasing operations, proceeds from aircraft sales and borrowings. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments and borrowings in order to grow and to maintain a young aircraft fleet. The cash flows from our operations, particularly our revenues from operating leases of aircraft, have historically provided a significant portion of the liquidity for these investments. Operating cash flows net of interest paid rose 13% in 2020 to US$1,355 million compared with 2019. In 2020 we issued US$2.9 billion of notes under our Global Medium Term Note Program. We also utilised US$1.1 billion under our committed revolving credit facilities as at 31 December 2020. Our gearing as at 31 December 2020 compared with 31 December 2019 increased as set out in the table below. 31 December Gross debt to equity (times) Net debt to equity (times) Gross debt is defined as loans and borrowings before adjustments for deferred debt issue costs, fair values, revaluations and discounts/premiums to medium term notes. Total equity refers to the equity attributable to Shareholders. Gross debt to equity is calculated by dividing gross debt by total equity. Net debt is defined as gross debt less cash and short-term deposits. Net debt to equity is calculated by dividing net debt by total equity. Operating cash flows net of interest is defined as net cash flows from operating activities less finance expenses paid. Our liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of US$408 million and US$4.7 billion in undrawn committed credit facilities as at 31 December 2020, comprising the unutilised portion of our revolving credit facilities and US$130 million in term loans that were unutilised as at 31 December 2020. Less: deferred debt issue costs, fair values, revaluations Number of aircraft pledged as security Net book value of aircraft pledged as security Indebtedness comprises our loans and borrowings before adjustments for deferred debt issue costs, fair values, revaluations and discounts/premiums to medium term notes. Of the total indebtedness, the amount of debt at fixed rates, including floating rate debt swapped to fixed rate liabilities, amounted to US$12.6 billion as at 31 December 2020 compared with US$10.4 billion as at 31 December 2019. Collateral for secured debt will typically include a mortgage over the relevant aircraft, an assignment of the operating lease of the relevant aircraft and/or a pledge of the shares in the subsidiary company that holds title to the relevant aircraft. In line with our strategy to reduce secured debt as a proportion of total assets and of total indebtedness, these proportions have come down in 2020 as set out in the table below: As at 31 December 2020, the debt repayment profile was as follows: Details of pledges of assets are included in Note 13 and Note 19 to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020. Our credit ratings remain unchanged, at A- for both Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings. Our transactional currency exposures mainly arise from borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than US Dollar, our functional currency. All loans and borrowings that are denominated in Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar are swapped into US Dollar. To eliminate foreign currency exposure that may arise, we utilise cross-currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar denominated financial liabilities. Such contracts are entered with counterparties that are rated at least A- by S&P Global Ratings. Under these agreements, we receive foreign currency amounts sufficient to meet the obligations in foreign currency borrowings and payment of US Dollar to the counterparties. Our estimated cash outflows based on aircraft capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2020 are set out below: 31 December 2020 The table above is based on estimated contractual capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2020 and includes all commitments to purchase aircraft, including those where an airline has a right to acquire the relevant aircraft on delivery. The capital expenditure figures for each year include anticipated escalation and are net of advance payments made before 31 December 2020. Taking account of developments between 31 December 2020 and 23 April 2021 (being the approval date of this annual report), including our commitment to purchase eight Airbus A320NEO aircraft announced on 1 March 2021 and other changes to the anticipated aircraft delivery schedule, our estimated cash outflows stated above would change as follows: Our aircraft purchase commitments as at 31 December 2020 are expected to be financed through a range of funding sources, including (a) cash flows generated from our operating activities, (b) proceeds from our notes issuance from debt capital markets, (c) amounts drawn down under our various bank financing facilities, and (d) net proceeds from sales of aircraft. We benefit from our strong investment grade corporate credit ratings of A- from both Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings and from our access to diverse debt funding sources. Our primary sources of debt funding are unsecured notes and unsecured and secured loan facilities. We have been an issuer of notes since 2000 and continue to regularly issue notes under our US$15 billion Global Medium Term Note Program. We also enjoy access to and continued support from a large group of lenders comprising over 70 financial institutions. We have US$5.7 billion in committed unsecured revolving credit facilities including a US$3.5 billion facility from Bank of China which matures in December 2026. As at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, we had 182 and 176 employees, respectively, who were engaged in the operation and management of our business. We provide certain benefits to our employees including retirement, health, life, disability and accident insurance coverage. We enter into individual employment contracts with our employees to cover matters such as wages, employee benefits, confidentiality and grounds for termination. We set targets for our employees based on their position and role and periodically assess their performance. The results of such assessments are used in their salary reviews, bonus awards and assessing promotions. The employee remuneration package generally comprises a basic salary and a discretionary bonus element. Our employee bonuses include two employee incentive plans as follows: (i) our short term incentive plan which is cash-based and payable over a maximum three year period, under which a bonus is payable to employees when certain key performance indicator targets for each year are met, and (ii) our long term incentive plan, under which a bonus is awarded to selected employees based on the achievement of certain key performance targets at the end of a pre-determined period. The long term incentive plan comprises a mix of cash-based and share- based elements. The share-based long term incentive plan involves the grant of awards in the form of RSUs, fulfilled through the purchase of Shares in the secondary market by an independent trustee after the announcement of results for the relevant financial year in which performance occurred. Upon vesting, RSUs will generally be satisfied by the transfer of Shares from the independent trustee to the employee. Three annual grants under the RSU Plan have been made since 2018, and each RSU award is amortised over the vesting period of approximately three years commencing from the date of grant. None of our employees are represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good employment relationships with our employees. For the year ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, our staff costs were US$68 million and US$80 million respectively, representing approximately 3.3% and 4.0% of the Group’s total revenues and other income of each year. During the year ended 31 December 2020, there was no material acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and affiliated companies by the Company. Please refer to Note 35 of the financial statements for details. During the year ended 31 December 2020, there was no significant investment held by the Company that constituted 5% or more of our total assets.

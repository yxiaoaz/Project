For the year ended Mining and ore processing facilities at Luanshya (Baluba Center Mine) Mining and leaching facilities at Luanshya (Muliashi Project) Mining facilities at Luanshya (Roan Mine) The total capital expenditure of the Group decreased by US$259.6 million from US$485.1 million in 2019 to US$225.5 million in 2020, mainly due to that the NFCA Chambishi Southeast Mine project and the Lualaba Copper Smelter projects were completed and put into operation in 2020. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group had in place the Financial Budget Management System, the Funds Management System, the Inventories Management System, the Fixed Assets Management System, the Financial Information Disclosure Management System, Management Measures on Approval Procedures and Permissions of Financial Income and Expenses of the Central Office and other financial policies, which aim to regulate and enhance internal control of relevant activities of the Group to ensure the safety of the Group’s assets, protect investors’ interests and improve operation and management level for compliance with relevant laws and regulations of Hong Kong as well as the Listing Rules. Please also refer to note 34 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for the financial instruments (which include the financial risk management objectives and policies). Although the Company has established a risk management system to identify, analyse, evaluate and respond to risks, our business activities are still subject to the following risks, which could have material impacts on our strategy, operations, compliance and financial condition. We urge you to carefully consider the risks described below. The Group’s commodity price risk mainly derives from the exposure to fluctuations in the market price of copper, since copper is the major commodities purchased, produced and sold by the Group. The sharp fluctuations of copper price mainly reflect the changes in supply and demand of copper products, the market uncertainties and other factors which are out of the control of the Group, including but not limited to the overall economic situation, political unrest, armed conflicts, terrorist acts, economic condition in major copper producing countries, accessibility of other metals, domestic and overseas regulations of governments, natural disasters and weather conditions. Price fluctuations will have a material impact on the business, cash flow and revenue of the Group. To mitigate this risk, the Group has adopted the sales strategy with combination of long- term and short-term orders and combined with hedging to enhance the turnover of spot inventory, so as to strive to reduce the commodity price risks. The Group operates business in Zambia and the DRC and most of its sales and purchases in the past were denominated in US dollar, its functional currency, while certain sales and purchases were settled in currencies other than its functional currency (mainly ZMK, Congolese Franc and RMB), which exposed the Group to foreign currency risk. To mitigate such risk, the Group engaged in foreign currency exchange hedging activities through various methods including locking the signing and settlement currency and expediting tax rebates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk of cash flow under the impact of interest rates changes of interest- bearing financial assets and liabilities, which mainly include interest-bearing restricted bank balances, bank balances and bank and other borrowings at variable interest rates. The Group currently does not have any interest rate hedging policy. However, the Directors will consider hedging significant interest rate risk should the need arise. In 2020, the Group spared no efforts in market expansion, with an equal emphasis on production and management, construction of projects and cost management. To this end, the operation quality and growth momentum improved and the main production and operation indicators of the Group has overfulfilled its annual budget and plan. During the reporting period, revenue has increased by 29.3% to US$2,597.2 million over the last year as a result of the continued growth in sales volumes of the Group's products and the impact of a year-on-year increase of international copper price. During the reporting period, the profit attributable to owners of the Company amounted to US$125.0 million, representing a decrease of US$9.9 million over the last year. Meanwhile, along with the commencement of operation of the projects including the Integrated Exploration and Construction Project of Chambishi Southeast Mine (with an investment of US$832 million), the blister copper smelting project of Lualaba Copper Smelter (with an investment of US$437.6 million) and the reconstruction and expansion project of CNMC Huachin Mabende as well as the construction of the Main mine project of Kambove Mining, the foundation for the Group’s business growth will be further consolidated. The Group is a leading, fast-growing and vertically integrated copper producer focusing on mining, ore- processing, leaching, smelting and sales of copper and cobalt, based in Zambia and the DRC. In particular, sulphuric acid and liquid sulphur dioxide are by-products generated during the blister copper smelting process. The Group is making greater efforts to develop cobalt business.

As of 31 December 2020, the Group employed a total of 8,352 employees (as of 31 December 2019: 8,188 employees), which comprised 877 Chinese and 7,475 local employees in Zambia and the DRC. Employees’ remuneration was determined by the Group based on their performance, experience and the prevailing market practice. For the year ended 31 December 2020, the total cost of employees reflected in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income amounted to approximately US$113.7 million (2019: US$103.9 million). 2020 was an extremely difficult and extraordinary year. In 2020, the Group made scientific decisions and proactive plans, focusing on both pandemic prevention and control and production and operation. The main businesses in Zambia and the DRC in Central and Southern Africa overcame various difficulties such as the impact of the pandemic, and achieved good results. As of 31 December 2020, the Group’s various production and operation and construction continued to progress in a steady and orderly manner. Looking forward to 2021, despite of the lingering complex and severe situation and the challenges entangled with opportunities, the Group expects many more opportunities than challenges, and considers it an exciting and promising year. From a global perspective, with the large-scale use of the COVID-19 vaccine, the world will gradually get rid of the haze of the pandemic and the economy will recover quickly in 2021. Insufficiency in global copper production and supply remains a prominent problem, providing a strong support for copper prices. The Group will continue to align with its own development strategy, enhance its investments in geological exploration and development, and identify suitable acquisition targets in regions with rich copper and cobalt resources such as Zambia and the DRC, with an aim to strengthen the Group’s resources. Meanwhile, based on the premise that effective efforts are made to implement regular pandemic prevention and control measures, the Group will stand committed to enhancing productivity by expanding capacity, reducing cost, improving quality and driving innovation, and strive for economic growth marked by quality and efficiency.

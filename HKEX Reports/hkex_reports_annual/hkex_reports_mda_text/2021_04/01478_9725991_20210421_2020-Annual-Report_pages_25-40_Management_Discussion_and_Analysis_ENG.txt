The steady growth in revenue was mainly attributable to the significant progress made in the implementation of the Group’s product structure optimisation strategy over the years, which led to a notable year-on-year increase in the average selling price of camera modules, driving the steady growth of the Group’s revenue from sales of camera modules for the Year as compared to that of last year.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly attributable to the profit of the Group for the Year increased rapidly as compared to last year, with net cash inflow from operating activities. During the Year, the Group recorded a net cash inflow from operating activities amounting approximately RMB3,603,951,000, representing an increase of approximately RMB1,204,400,000 as compared with the net cash inflow of approximately RMB2,399,551,000 in 2019, which was mainly attributable to the steady growth of revenue and steady increase of gross profit margin of the Group during the Year as compared to that of last year, and with the strong support from its overall customers, the overall turnover days of accounts receivables and bills receivables decreased from approximately 109 days in last year to approximately 87 days, while turnover days of trade and other payables were similar to that of last year.

The Group is exposed to currency risk primarily due to certain receivables, payables, cash balances and loans that are denominated in foreign currencies other than RMB arising from the operating activities such as bank borrowings, product sales and purchase of raw materials. The Group is also exposed to currency risk from the exchange or translation of USD and Hong Kong Dollars into RMB. During the Period, as the sales income of the Group was still mainly settled in RMB but various raw materials for production and some equipment for production were purchased from overseas and settled in USD, while the central parity rate of RMB against USD recorded an upward adjustment of approximately 6.5% from 6.9762 at the beginning of the Year to 6.5249 at the end of the Year, the Group eventually recorded a loss for the realised or unrealised foreign option contracts previously entrusted, and the amount of which exceeded the foreign exchange revenue and the revenue amount of realised and unrealised foreign currency forward contracts. As such, the Group recorded an exchange loss of approximately RMB45,952,000, representing an increase as compared to approximately RMB35,738,600 in 2019. As affected by multiple factors such as politics, economic, and supply and demand, the trend of RMB against USD in the future is subject to great uncertainties. It is difficult to adjust the business model of the Group in the short run. Therefore, the profit or loss of the Group may still be affected by exchange rate fluctuation in the future. The Group will, on one hand, continuously strive to strengthen the expansion of overseas business and strive to reduce the proportion of USD expense; on the other hand, the Group will continuously enhance daily monitoring of the exchange rate, and fix the future foreign exchange costs by properly using financial instruments, so as to strengthen the management of foreign exchange risks and strive to reduce foreign exchange loss. However, the Group is also clearly aware that there are many factors affecting exchange rates, and the mechanism to determine exchange rate is complicated and fickle, making it is difficult to estimate its trend. Therefore, the profit or loss of the Group may still be affected by exchange rate fluctuation. On 2 December 2014, the shares (the “Shares”) of the Company were initially listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange by global offering.

In 2020, New Focus Auto Tech Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) focused on the research and development, manufacturing and sales of automotive electronic products, as well as construction and development of automobile dealership networks and automotive product e-commerce platforms. The automotive electronic products that the Group produces mainly include inverters, chargers, multi-functional power packs and cooling and heating boxes, which are mainly sold to the markets of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”), North America and Europe. The Group’s automobile dealership and service business is operated mainly in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for automobile sales, automotive after-sales service, as well as the distribution of car insurance products and automobile financial products. The automotive product e-commerce platform of the Group provides customers with the purchase, delivery and warehousing services of automotive repair parts and components and automotive products. During the year ended 31 December 2020 (the “Year”), the consolidated revenue from continuing operations of the Group amounted to approximately RMB911,727,000 (2019: RMB1,750,632,000), representing a decrease of approximately 47.92%, which was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group, leading to the significant decrease in the revenue from the wholesale service business and the automobile dealership and service business of the Group. The consolidated revenue of the wholesale service business of the Group was approximately RMB20,814,000 (2019: RMB61,285,000), representing a decrease of approximately 66.04%, which was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic leading to the decrease in sales of various products. The consolidated revenue of the manufacturing business of the Group was approximately RMB536,837,000 (2019: RMB468,050,000), representing an increase of approximately 14.70%, which was mainly attributable to the active sourcing of new customers, optimization of customer and product structure, as well as the increase in selling price of products for certain customers. The consolidated revenue of the Group’s automobile dealership and service business was approximately RMB354,076,000 (2019: RMB1,221,297,000), representing a decrease of approximately 71.01%. Such decrease was mainly attributable to two reasons: first, the operations of automobile dealer shops were suspended for a long time during the Year under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and second, local banks in Inner Mongolia tightened the standards for credit approval in response to local economic downturn, and vigorously required enterprises with operations in Inner Mongolia to repay their loans. As a result of the abovementioned change in bank policy, the Group’s automobile dealership and service business faced enormous pressure in relation to cash flow. Therefore, the Group decided to temporarily scale down. Certain dealer shops were closed while some shops only maintained after-sales services, which led to the withdrawal of the authorized dealership of some automotive brands. The consolidated gross profit from continuing operation for the Year was approximately RMB104,411,000 (2019: RMB140,082,000), representing a decrease of approximately 25.46%; gross profit margin increased from 8.00% to 11.45%. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in revenue from the wholesale service business and the automobile dealership and service business of the Group for the Year as compared with last year. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the decrease in the proportion of the revenue from the automobile dealership and service business with relatively low profit margin to the Group’s total revenue for the Year as compared with last year. The gross profit of the Group’s wholesale service business was approximately RMB3,975,000 (2019: RMB10,757,000), representing a decrease of approximately 63.05%; gross profit margin increased from approximately 17.55% to approximately 19.10%. The decrease in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant decrease in revenue for the Year as compared with last year; while the increase in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to the optimization of product structure and the elimination of products with low gross profit margin of the wholesale business during the Year. The gross profit of the Group’s manufacturing business was approximately RMB86,424,000 (2019: RMB72,553,000), representing an increase of approximately 19.12%. The gross profit margin increased from approximately 15.50% to approximately 16.10%. The increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the increase in revenue for the Year as compared with last year. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the optimization of customer structure and product structure, the decrease in proportion of sales revenue from products with low gross profit margin and the increase in selling price for certain customers. The gross profit of the Group’s automobile dealership and service business was approximately RMB14,012,000 (2019: RMB56,772,000), representing a decrease of approximately 75.32%; gross profit margin decreased from approximately 4.65% to approximately 3.96%. The decrease in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant decrease in revenue for the Year as compared with last year. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the decline in the profit of new automotive sales as a result of the overall downturn in China’s automotive sales industry during the Year. Other losses from continuing operations for the Year was approximately RMB31,373,000 (2019: gain of RMB4,153,000). The turnaround from gain to loss was mainly due to the increase of RMB29,904,000 in impairment loss arising from the written-off of other receivable during the Year as compared with that of 2019. Moreover, the fair value change in the embedded derivative financial instruments in relation to the convertible notes in the principal amount of USD35,000,000 due in 2020 (the “CCBC Convertible Notes”) of the Company, which was issued to High Inspiring Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of China Construction Bank Corporation, on 1 September 2017, recording a revenue of RMB13,624,000 in 2019, while there was no such revenue during the Year. Allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables, deposits, prepayments and other receivables and amounts due from related parties from continuing operations for the Year was approximately RMB298,673,000 (2019: RMB16,044,000). The trade receivables, deposits, prepayments and other receivables (the “Receivables”) on which most of the impairment losses were recognised were due from Inner Mongolia Lifeng Dingsheng Automobile Co., Ltd.* ( ) (“Lifeng Dingsheng”) and its subsidiaries and associates (collectively, the “Lifeng Dingsheng Group”), which are primarily engaged in automobile dealership and service business in Inner Mongolia. For the reasons and other details for impairment on Receivables for the Year, please refer to the section headed “Collection of Receivables” in this annual report. The distribution costs from continuing operations for the Year were approximately RMB101,629,000 (2019: RMB169,649,000), representing a decrease of approximately 40.09%, which was mainly attributable to the decrease in salaries and bonuses of sales personnel, freight, and other sales and marketing expenses as a result of the decline in consolidated revenue during the Year. The administrative expenses from continuing operations for the Year were approximately RMB81,232,000 (2019: RMB102,502,000), representing a decrease of approximately 20.75%, which was mainly due to the Group’s control of the number of management personnel and the reduction of administrative expenses. The operating loss from continuing operations of the Group during the Year was approximately RMB408,496,000 (2019: RMB143,960,000). The increase in loss was mainly attributable to the increase in impairment loss on the Group’s trade and other receivables of RMB282,629,000 for the Year as compared with that of 2019 (the “Increase in Impairment Loss”). The finance costs from continuing operation for the Year amounted to approximately RMB42,880,000 (2019: RMB63,390,000), representing a decrease of approximately 32.36%. Such decrease was mainly attributable to the interest expenses of approximately RMB24,298,000 incurred in relation to the CCBC Convertible Notes in 2019, while there were no such expenses this Year. The income tax expenses from continuing operation for the Year were approximately RMB22,282,000 (2019: income tax credit of approximately RMB33,804,000). The loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company from continuing and discontinued operations during the Year was approximately RMB466,748,000 (2019: RMB191,108,000). Excluding the Increase in Impairment Loss, the loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company would have decreased by RMB6,989,000 as compared with that of 2019, which was mainly due to the strict control of costs and various expenditures during the Year. The loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations during the Year was approximately RMB6.90 cents (2019: loss per share of RMB2.82 cents). The Group continued to maintain a stable financial position and the liquidity of assets of the Group remained healthy during the Year. The Group had a net cash inflow from operating activities of approximately RMB68,568,000 (2019: RMB53,584,000). Non-current assets were approximately RMB278,559,000 as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: RMB365,408,000). Net current assets were approximately RMB157,752,000 as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: RMB562,676,000). Gearing ratio (calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets) was approximately 78.87% as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 58.11%). The increase in gearing ratio was mainly due to the recognition of impairment loss on the Receivables from Lifeng Dingsheng Group during the Year. As at 31 December 2020, the total bank and other borrowings of the Group were approximately RMB340,744,000 (31 December 2019: RMB489,982,000), of which approximately 31.79% were made in United States Dollars (“USD”) and approximately 68.21% were made in Renminbi (“RMB”). All of the borrowings were repayable at fixed interest rates, of which approximately RMB286,595,000 was repayable within one year and approximately RMB54,149,000 was repayable after one year but within five years. The Group’s need for borrowings was generally stable during the Year. As at 31 December 2020, the committed borrowing facilities available to but not utilized by the Group amounted to approximately RMB9,933,000. The Group maintains strong and sufficient operating cash flow, bank deposits and banking facilities to finance its daily operation. The Receivables of the Group mainly include the amount owed by the Lifeng Dingsheng Group to Inner Mongolia Chuangying Auto Co., Ltd. (“Inner Mongolia Chuangying”), a subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiaries (“Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables”). As of 31 December 2020, the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables amounted to approximately RMB613,481,000. The Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables mainly arose from the amount of RMB655,652,000 owed by the Lifeng Dingsheng Group to Inner Mongolia Chuangying and its subsidiaries before the completion of the acquisition of 100% equity interest of Inner Mongolia Chuangying from Lifeng Dingsheng by the Group on 30 September 2018 (the “Acquisition”). Details of the Acquisition were set out in the circular of the Company dated 24 August 2018. The works related to the Acquisition commenced in September 2017 and were primarily undertaken by Mr. Du Jinglei (“Mr. Du”), the then sole executive director of the Company and chairman of the Board. Mr. Du has been the chairman and legal representative of Lifeng Dingsheng since January 2017. He resigned as the legal representative in November 2018 but still holds the position of chairman. On 1 July 2019, Mr. Du resigned as the executive director and chairman of the Board of the Company. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Du was fully responsible for the operation and management of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group, and he was the core operating management personnel of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group. At the end of June 2020, Mr. Du’s case was heard by the court for the first time. The case is currently under trial and the court has not made a final judgement. In order to determine the collectability of the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables, an investigation team established by the Group commenced to carry out an on-site due diligence on the financial and operational position of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group in mid-July 2020. The investigation team led by Mr. Zhao Yufeng, the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company, thereafter travelled to Inner Mongolia several times to communicate with related parties with a view to seeking and implementing the best solution for collecting the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables as soon as possible. The relevant information on the Lifeng Dingsheng Group obtained by the investigation team primarily includes: After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the business operation of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group shrank significantly and continued to be affected by the pandemic, and the revenue generated in 2020 was significantly lower than 2019, and no substantial improvement has been made in its operation up to now; Local banks in Inner Mongolia have tightened their credit approval criteria in response to the local economic recession, and have actively asked enterprises operating in Inner Mongolia to repay their loans, which has put enormous pressure on the cash flow of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group, resulting According to the documents provided by the Lifeng Dingsheng Group, Mr. Du has also provided personal guarantee for loans provided by financial institutions, which had close relationship with or were under the control of automobile manufacturers, as well as a number of banks to the Lifeng Dingsheng Group. As a result of Mr. Du’s arrest as mentioned above, these banks and other creditors have strengthened their efforts to collect their amounts owed by the Lifeng Dingsheng Group, and some of the automobile manufacturers have ceased or opted not to renew the dealership authorisations previously granted to the Lifeng Dingsheng Group. Based on the above information, the Company believes that there has been a substantial risk of the liquidity of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group. In the event of Mr. Du being convicted, together with the poor operation conditions of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group, it is likely that the creditors of the Lifeng Dingsheng Group would collect their creditor’s rights by judicial means. In case of the above situation, the Lifeng Dingsheng Group may be forced in the legal proceedings to dispose of the land use rights and properties, being its main assets, and the proceeds from which will be used to repay debts. According to the judicial practice in China, the proceeds from disposal of assets during the legal proceedings are usually significantly lower than its reasonable value. Based on the above considerations, the Company has provided for a significant amount of impairment losses on the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables during the year ended 31 December 2020. As of the date of this annual report, the Group has taken the following measures to collect the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables: Has completed the charge of the creditor’s rights due from third parties owned by Lifeng Dingsheng as security for the Lifeng Dingsheng Group’s repayment of the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables. The abovementioned charged creditor’s rights amounted to approximately RMB596,800,000 in aggregate, Has procured Lifeng Dingsheng to charge its equity interests in several of its subsidiaries to the Group. Based on the above measures adopted, the Board considers that it is not necessary to further provide for the impairment of Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables. The management of the Group will monetize its charged entity interests and creditor’s right in a reasonable manner in due course in order to collect the Lifeng Dingsheng Receivables. The Group has adopted a prudent financial management approach towards its treasury policies and thus maintained a healthy position of liquidity during the Year. To manage liquidity risks, the Board closely monitors the Group’s liquidity position to ensure that the liquidity structure of the Group’s assets, liabilities and other commitments can meet its funding requirements from time to time. Approximately 75% of the revenue of the Group’s manufacturing business was generated from the export of its products which was settled in USD, while other businesses were all in China. As such, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are denominated in RMB and USD. As at 31 December 2020, the total assets of the Group were RMB1,291,232,000 (31 December 2019: RMB1,937,231,000), which included: (1) share capital of RMB556,286,000 (31 December 2019: RMB556,286,000); (2) reserves of RMB(283,431,000) (31 December 2019: RMB255,313,000); and (3) liabilities of RMB1,018,377,000 (31 December 2019: RMB1,125,632,000). As at 31 December 2020, the net book values of inventory, investment properties, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets/leasehold land and land use rights pledged as security for the Group’s bank borrowings totaled approximately RMB100,056,000 (31 December 2019: RMB178,168,000). On 2 July 2020, Inner Mongolia Chuangying, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an equity transfer agreement with Xilinguolemeng Lifeng Xinlu Second-hand Auto Vehicle Market Co., Ltd.* ( , “Lifeng Xinlu”). Pursuant to the equity transfer agreement, Lifeng Xinlu agreed to acquire 54.5% equity interests in Hinggan Lifeng Taiyu Motor Sales Co., Ltd.* ( , “Hinggan Taiyu”) held by Inner Mongolia Chuangying (the “Hinggan Taiyu Equity Disposal”) at the transfer consideration of RMB4,409,772. After completion of the Hinggan Taiyu Equity Disposal on 2 July 2020, Hinggan Taiyu ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company. On 3 July 2020, Inner Mongolia Chuangying entered into an equity transfer agreement with Xilinguolemeng Zhongyi Trading Co., Ltd.* ( , “Zhongyi Trading”). Pursuant to the equity transfer agreement, Zhongyi Trading agreed to acquire 54.5% equity interests in Ulanhot Lifeng Taidi Automobile Sales and Services Co., Ltd.* ( ), 54.5% equity interests in Hinggan Taihong Wuling Motor Sales Co., Ltd.* ( ) and 100% equity interests in Hinggan Lifeng Taiyu Automobile Services Co., Ltd.* ( ) held by Inner Mongolia Chuangying (the “Equity Disposal of Three Companies”) at the transfer consideration of RMB990,385, RMB4,350,434 and RMB8,387,167, respectively, totalling RMB13,727,986. After completion of the Equity Disposal of Three Companies on 3 July 2020, the above three companies ceased to be subsidiaries of the Company. Each of Lifeng Xinlu, Zhongyi Trading and their respective ultimate beneficial owners is a third party independent of the Company and its connected persons, and the disposals did not constitute notifiable (the “Listing Rules”) on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ( the “Stock Exchange”). The Group had no significant investments during the Year. The Group has no specific plans for material future investments or acquisition of business. The Group’s wholesale service business as well as automotive dealership and service business mainly take place in China, with the settlement currency being RMB. Hence, there is no exchange risk. Approximately 75% of the revenue from the Group’s manufacturing business was generated from the export of its products which was settled in USD. The materials used to produce such products were purchased in RMB. Therefore, the depreciation of USD against RMB would normally have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Group’s manufacturing business. The Group managed its exposure to USD foreign currency risks by making USD borrowings to mitigate such exchange risks. As at 31 December 2020, the amount of the Group’s USD borrowings was approximately USD16,499,000 (31 December 2019: USD4,000,000). The Group faces other material risks and uncertainties, which mainly include the future development of the PRC’s economy and Sino-US relationship. Should the PRC’s economy suffer from downturn, the willingness and capability of consumers in purchasing new automobiles and automobile-related products and services will be negatively affected, which will in turn reduce the revenue of the automobile dealership and services business of the Group. As the US is the major export market of the Group’s manufacturing business, should the Sino-US relationship deteriorates, the results of the manufacturing business of the Group may be affected. Having adopted methods of streamlining the personnel structure and reducing other expenses reasonably to cut costs, the Group will pay close attention to the economic trend of the PRC and deal with those risks and uncertainties in a timely manner. Meanwhile, the Group will strive to expand the domestic market for its manufacturing business, so as to reduce the reliance on the export market. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had no significant contingent liabilities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group employed a total of 1,142 full-time employees (31 December 2019: 1,591), of which 251 (31 December 2019: 284) were managerial staff. The Group’s remuneration policies are formulated to attract talent and retain quality staff. The remuneration package for the Group’s employees includes wages, incentives (such as performance-based bonus) and allowances. The Group also provides social security insurance and benefits to its employees, and formulates and implements share option scheme as a long-term incentive scheme of the Group. Details of the share options scheme will be disclosed in the “Report of the Directors” of this annual report of the Company. The Group emphasizes the importance of staff development and provides relevant training programs on an ongoing basis with reference to its strategic objectives and the performance of its staff. The Group has been continuously promoting the establishment and improvement of environment-related management mechanism and system. Such systems require all the employees of the Group to comply with the applicable environmental laws and regulations in their daily work. The automobile distributions branches of the Group have obtained approval from environmental protection authorities prior to commencement of operations and strictly complied with applicable environmental laws and regulations in the subsequent operation, to minimize the damages to the environment. The manufacturing business of the Group proactively incorporates the concept of environmental protection into product design and manufacturing, with a view to providing energy-saving and environmentally friendly products to customers. The Group encourages its employees to save energy and treasure resources. During the Year, the Group complied with the relevant laws and regulations that had a significant impact on the operations of the Group in all material respects, which cover various aspects such as labor, fire prevention, environmental protection and product liability, including but not limited to the Law of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China ( ), the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the People’s Republic of China ( ), the Law of Prevention and Control of Environmental Noise Pollution of the People’s Republic of China ( ), the Labor Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China ( ), the Law on Product Quality of the People’s Republic of China ( ), the Law on Trademark of the People’s Republic of China ( ) and the Law on Advertising of the People’s Republic of China ( ). The Group attaches great importance to the relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and other relevant parties since such relationships are key to the Group’s sustainable development. The Group adheres to the principle of legality, fairness, reasonableness and mutual benefit in its daily operation and duly handles the relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and other relevant parties. According to the statistics of China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the sales volume of passenger vehicles in the PRC was approximately 20,178,000 for the Year, representing a decrease of approximately 6.0% as compared with 2019. Based on the analysis of China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused grim challenges and major difficulties to the automobile industry. Such a downward trend is yet to be reversed even as the improving pandemic situation lifted the industrial climate in the second half of the Year. The Group’s automotive dealership and services business network is located in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and its main businesses include automobile sales and after-sales service, as well as the distribution of car insurance products and financial products. In the first half of 2020, the Chinese passenger vehicles market sustained its negative growth amid the COVID-19 outbreak and the macroeconomic downturn in China. Such unfavorable market environment across the Chinese automobile industry, together with the COVID-19 pandemic, dampened income expectations and automobile demands among consumers. Primarily due to the above reasons and the tightening standards for credit approval by local banks in Inner Mongolia, the Group recorded a plunge in business revenue from its dealer shops in the first few months of 2020, coupled with the continued necessity to pay such fixed expenses as rents, employee salaries and social insurance contributions. This led to unsatisfactory operating results in the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, affected by the COVID-19 resurgence in Hebei Province and the positive results of nucleic acid test for the outer packaging of automotive parts in multiple locations, the Group’s automobile parks cooperated with local governments on quarantine operations for nearly three months to prevent the spread of the epidemic, which battered the procurement and sales of vehicles as well as automotive parts and components in November and December 2020. The Group mainly implemented the following operating strategies for the automotive dealership and services business in 2020: Firstly, we closed certain dealer shops with poor operating efficiency, and integrated and leased relevant idle fixed assets. Secondly, we consolidated the management departments of our headquarters to streamline the management. At the same time, we downsized the proportion of management personnel at our stores to improve management efficiency. Thirdly, we introduced automotive brands that suit the habits of local customers, such as EXEED ( ). Fourthly, we gradually restored such brand licensing that ceased operations under the COVID-19 impact, such as Dongfeng Peugeot ( ) and GAC FCA ( ). Fifthly, we started operating the derivative business of automobile sales such as second-hand automobile dealership and agency for vehicle license application. It is expected that the automotive dealership industry will remain under considerable pressure in the short run. To improve its operating results, the Group plans to adopt the following operating strategies in 2021: Firstly, we will continue to optimize the structure of automotive brands under the Group’s dealership to align with the general trend of consumption upgrade in automobiles, by introducing new energy vehicle brands and resuming the dealership of our proprietary automotive brands with market potential. Secondly, in terms of sales, we will strengthen the design of retail products package and the usage of differentiated marketing strategy. For after-sales service, we will enhance the management and development of existing customer resources, and refine the management and control of the after-sales business process to improve customer satisfaction. Thirdly, we will focus on lean management, optimize the responsibility system of operation targets in each of the automotive dealership networks, and organize the operation and management processes in an all- rounded manner, with an aim of enhancing the operating efficiency. The Group operated the automotive products wholesale business based on the e-commerce platform “Auto Make” ( ). Catering to small retail service outlets, the platform provides customers with the purchase, delivery and warehousing services for repair and maintenance parts and components as well as automotive products. At the same time, relevant manufacturers and major wholesalers have also been enticed to set up their stores on the “Auto Make” platform, and Auto Make provides sales, payment collection and delivery services for such stores. As such, Auto Make has become an e-commerce platform that integrates self-operated wholesale business and third-party sales of automotive products. The export business of the Group was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. On top of work and production resumption, we optimized the structures of our product category and pricing as well as production organization model from the perspectives of customer and order structures, payment credit, dynamic receivables, finished goods inventories and order data analysis. As such, we saw a marked increase in the export business in the second half of the Year. We will strengthen our management and implement various operating strategies according to the established strategic arrangements. Given that our manufacturing business will remain affected by the Sino-US trade war, the fluctuation of RMB exchange rate and the price fluctuation of bulk materials, we need to continuously observe the trends of market operation and strengthen our communication with suppliers and customers to timely adjust our strategies. Our pre-installation business focuses on ensuring supply, collecting payments in a timely manner and exploring new customers. We recorded a much larger volume of our traditional OEM business, whereas the operations relating to new energy vehicles were materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By adhering to the principles of “seeking survival, controlling categories, enhancing efficiency”, we implemented various operating strategies in our domestic sale business, such as collecting prepayment before taking orders, receiving full payments before shipment, reviewing product inventory, intensifying the promotion of non-regular products and optimizing the star product service system, through which our cash flow and resource utilization efficiency significantly improved. The general operating results of the Group’s manufacturing business still advanced significantly under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with progress made in appealing to new customers and launching new products. In respect of its manufacturing business, the Group will improve management efficiency and capture market opportunities with acumen in 2021, through an optimized organizational structure, more team incentives and further resource integration, so as to further improve its performance on top of better customer and product structures and greater customer stickiness. In 2021, the Group will assess its existing businesses and consider appropriate disposal of relevant businesses with long-term loss and uncertain prospects, so as to optimize resources allocation and improve the Group’s profitability. In addition, the Group will also consider acquiring businesses with high profitability and growth potential as opportunities arise, to improve the operating results of the Group.

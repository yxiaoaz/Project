2020 is undoubtedly an extraordinary year. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020, the pandemic has hit hard on the economies of Macau, Hong Kong and nearby regions as well as the global economy. This unprecedent pandemic has created worldwide global health crises and severely undermined the customers’ confidence and patterns on purchase on many vulnerable businesses including gaming. As part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Macau, the Macau government announced the suspension of operations of all casinos in Macau for at least 15 days from 5 February 2020. Operations in Casino Kam Pek Paradise were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 20 February 2020 while operations in Casino Waldo were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 24 February 2020. Moreover, the Macau government has adopted a series of restrictions and quarantine requirement policies to prohibit or significantly reduce non-local citizens from entering into Macau. According to the statistical information published by DICJ, Macau’s total GGR for the year ended 31 December 2020 declined by 79.3% from MOP292.4 billion to MOP60.4 billion when compared to the year ended 31 December 2019. Arrivals in Macau tumbled 85.0% from about 39.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 to 5.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, leaving casinos in Macau devoid of customers. It is reasonable to expect that the social and economic activities would not be able to resume to normal within a short period of time, and the requisite time for the full economic recovery of Macau and the world would remain to be seen. The contract for the Group’s provision of casino management services in Casino Waldo expired on 29 February 2020. Having considered a number of factors thoroughly, in particular, (i) the capital injection requirement on additional monitoring system and equipment to Casino Waldo for the compliance of the new regulatory requirements which would not be recovered before the end of the existing gaming concession according to our analysis; (ii) the relatively high operating costs of the casino; and (iii) also the adverse impact from the outbreak of Covid-19, the Group ultimately decided not to request for renewal or extension of the contract. Accordingly, our provision of casino management services in Casino Waldo terminated since 1 March 2020. During the year under review, the Group has undertaken a detailed review to identify its strengths in facing this pandemic and explored other businesses in this connection for such attainments. During the extraordinary time, for instance, the Group has made use of its extensive network in the PRC to provide procurement services for overseas customers which has made positive contribution to the Group’s results for the year. Total reported revenue of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 was HK$351.7 million, representing a decrease of 70.2% over that of HK$1,181.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in revenue from provision of casino management services as a result of the outbreak of Covid-19 since early 2020 and the cessation of our provision of casino management services in Casino Waldo since 1 March 2020, and from sale of electronic gaming equipment and systems. An analysis of the reported revenue by properties/nature is as follows: Casinos under the Group’s management: Electronic gaming equipment and systems: Leasing of electronic gaming equipment and systems* Leasing revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 did not include the intercompany revenue derived from the LMG terminals deployed at the casinos under the Group’s management amounting to HK$70.1 million (2019: HK$149.0 million) which was included in the reported revenue of respective casinos under the Group’s management in the above table. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2020 was a loss of HK$101.1 million, as compared to the Adjusted EBITDA of HK$87.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The following table reconciles (loss) profit for the year to Adjusted EBITDA: (192.1) Adjustments for: (1.8) (5.1) Taxation charge (credit) (4.5) (101.1) An analysis of Adjusted EBITDA by properties/nature is as follows: Casinos under the Group’s management: (42.7) (17.8) (27.5) (60.5) Electronic gaming equipment and systems: (11.2) (64.0) (88.5) (71.6) (32.4) (101.1) Adjusted EBITDA from casinos under the Group’s management segment for the year ended 31 December 2020 was a loss of HK$60.5 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of HK$114.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The change was mainly due to the decrease in GGR generated by Casino Kam Pek Paradise (for the year ended 31 December 2020) and Casino Waldo (for the period from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020) when compared to those generated for the year ended 31 December 2019. Operations in Casino Kam Pek Paradise were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 20 February 2020 while operations in Casino Waldo were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 24 February 2020. Moreover, during the year under review, the Macau government has also adopted certain policies to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Macau including limiting the numbers of gaming tables, ETG machines and slot machines in operation in casinos, quarantine requirements or proof of negative test result for Covid-19 for all travellers entering into Macau, etc. In addition, the Group ceased to provide casino management services in Casino Waldo since 1 March 2020. All these have caused decrease in GGR generated by the casinos under the Group’s management and hence affected the Group’s business of provision of casino management services for the year under review. Adjusted EBITDA from the electronic gaming equipment and systems segment for the year ended 31 December 2020 was a loss of HK$71.6 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of HK$5.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The change was mainly caused by the decrease in sale of electronic gaming equipment and systems for the year ended 31 December 2020 when compared to the year ended 31 December 2019. Albeit the tough business environment, the Group continued to invest in research and development and other costs on electronic gaming equipment and systems of HK$64.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 in order to prepare for increasing our competitive advantages and getting more market shares in the long run. Adjusted EBITDA of other businesses in the above table comprised positive contribution of HK$53.9 million (2019: nil) from the Group’s provision of procurement services for the year ended 31 December 2020 which was offset by net corporate and other expenses of the Group of HK$22.9 million (2019: HK$32.4 million). The Group recorded a loss of HK$192.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to a profit of HK$10.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The following table sets out average numbers of gaming tables, LMG terminals and slot machines in operation for the provision of casino management services by the Group for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019: (Average no. of units) Casino Kam Pek Casino Waldo* Casino Kam Pek Casino The numbers shown in the above table for Casino Waldo for the year ended 31 December 2020 were for the period from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 As at 31 December 2020, the Group had a total of 49 gaming tables in Casino Kam Pek Paradise under the Group’s management which were all in operation. As at 31 December 2019, the Group had a total of 49 and 30 gaming tables in Casino Kam Pek Paradise and Casino Waldo, respectively, which were all in operation.

Total GGR generated by Casino Waldo for the period from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 amounted to HK$43.4 million, as compared to the amount of HK$547.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Breakdown of the revenue attributable to the Group for the two casinos under the Group’s management for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 is as follows: Casino Kam Pek Paradise: Casino Waldo*: The numbers shown in the above table for Casino Waldo for the year ended 31 December 2020 were for the period from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 Total revenue attributable to the Group generated by the casinos under the Group’s management for the year ended 31 December 2020 was HK$326.4 million, representing a decrease of 67.5% over that of HK$1,004.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The decrease in total revenue was due to the decrease in revenue from Casino Kam Pek Paradise for the year ended 31 December 2020 when compared to that for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the Group’s cessation of provision of casino management services in Casino Waldo since 1 March 2020. Development, Sale and Leasing of Electronic Gaming Equipment and Systems and Royalty For the year ended 31 December 2020, revenue from sale of electronic gaming equipment and systems amounted to HK$20.9 million, representing a decrease of 87.7% over that of HK$169.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 comprised revenue derived in Macau of HK$19.3 million (mainly from the sale of 20 LMG terminals and the provision of upgrading services to 438 LMG terminals in Macau) and overseas of HK$1.6 million (mainly from the sale of 23 slot machines). Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 was derived mainly from sale of 799 LMG terminals and provision of upgrading services to 1,051 LMG terminals in Macau. For the year ended 31 December 2020, revenue from leasing of electronic gaming equipment and systems amounted to HK$3.1 million, representing a decrease of 40.4% over that of HK$5.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 comprised revenue derived from leasing of electronic gaming equipment and systems in Macau of HK$2.6 million (2019: HK$4.0 million) and overseas of HK$0.5 million (2019: HK$1.2 million). In April 2016, the Group entered into a strategic agreement with IGT whereby the Group has assigned and licensed certain patents and associated technology to IGT in return for a non-refundable upfront payment of US$12.95 million (approximately HK$101.0 million) and a 15-year earn-out payment for every related ETG machine deployed in the global market (other than Macau). With reference to the royalty statements provided by IGT to the Group, the Group recognised royalty income of HK$1.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: HK$2.5 million). Up to 31 December 2020, the Group has accumulatively recognised a total royalty income of HK$9.4 million from IGT. The uncertainties over the global economy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have continued to intensify during the year under review and beyond. These factors continue to affect the overall strategy of the Group’s businesses, and accordingly the operations as well as the financial performance. During the period under review, the Group has undertaken a detailed review to identify its strengths in facing this pandemic and explored other businesses in this connection for such attainments. So long as the Covid-19 pandemic situation continues to evolve, the Group will continuously evaluate the situation, where appropriate, make timely announcements on material business developments, in order to keep Shareholders and investors timely informed. As part of the measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Macau, the Macau government announced the suspension of operations of all casinos in Macau for at least 15 days from 5 February 2020. The Group’s operations in Casino Kam Pek Paradise were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 20 February 2020 while operations in Casino Waldo were suspended on 5 February 2020 and resumed on 24 February 2020. Moreover, during the year under review, the Macau government has also adopted certain policies to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Macau including limiting the numbers of gaming tables, ETG machines and slot machines in operation in casinos, quarantine requirement or proof of negative test result for Covid-19 for all travellers entering into Macau. As a result, such policies and measures prohibited and significantly reduced non-local citizens from entering into Macau, and accordingly the patrons to the casinos under the Group’s management. The pandemic has swept the globe and most casinos, especially those in U.S., Macau and other Southeast Asian countries, which were also shut down for certain periods during the period under review. This has inevitably affected the deployment plan of our self-developed slot machines in these markets. Since the Group has always adopted a prudent financial management approach towards its financial and treasury policies, and despite the Covid-19 pandemic and during the year under review, the Group was on track with this approach to maintain a healthy liquidity position. The Board shall closely monitor the Group’s liquidity position to ensure that the liquidity structure of the Group’s assets, liabilities and other commitments can meet its funding requirements from time to time. Measures such as Cost Control, Funding and Adjustment to Business Plans to Manage the To attenuate the adverse effects to the Group as a result of the pandemic, the Group has taken various measures on cost control to reduce costs, including reducing marketing and promotional expenses of the casinos under the Group’s management, requesting and lobbying landlords to reduce rents, and introducing family care leaves to employees, etc. Strategically, the Group decided not to renew the casino management services contract in Casino Waldo after its expiry on 29 February 2020 which has proved itself on the right move for cost control programme. The Group will continue to monitor and review its operating cost level and implement further effective measures so as to keep the Group’s competitiveness. The Group has also made use of its extensive network in the PRC to provide procurement services for overseas customers which has made positive contribution to the Group’s results for the year under review. The Group will continue to explore more business opportunities in this economically recessive period. 2020 has been an exceptionally challenging and difficult time for all business sectors, and the gaming industry was no exception, as Covid-19 has impacted every sphere of life and has upended all economies including Macau, Hong Kong and nearby regions as well as the global economy, with travel, tourism, retail and gaming being some of the worst hit industries. The pandemic has brought not only the regional, but global travel and tourism industry almost to a standstill. Gaming markets in Macau and other major jurisdictions have been significantly disrupted as a result of Covid-19. Nevertheless, the year of 2020 was a remarkable year for our electronic gaming equipment and systems segment in terms of deployment of new slot machines. Recently, our new “Jackpot Series” has just been approved for the Macau market, which contains a group of slot games that are straight-forward, simple and perfectly suited for high denomination areas with non-progressive, standalone progress and linked progressive options. The first two games of the series approved in Macau, namely “Jackpot Tornado” and “Jackpot Bonus”, have received encouraging results in the North American markets and other games in the series are due out soon. Our another brand-new slot game, namely, “TEKKEN” series has also hit the market. Being a famous Japanese media franchise, TEKKEN centered on a series of fighting video and arcade games, which have been very popular with players over decades. The Group is dedicated to continuous innovation in the gaming equipment industry using top-notch and innovative technology to create more good gaming products that are primarily catered for mass market. We trust technology and innovation would be the key to driving future growth despite the pandemic. The Group shall continue to focus on optimising table productivity in the casino under our management by applying cutting-edge gaming technology that has enabled our GGR per table per day in the mass market to rival the tables in other casinos in Macau. The Group will follow our unique business model to embrace more synergies of our two business segments which complement the development of our high-tech products. In recent years, the Group has also increased its investment on research and development for the attainments of innovation and breakthrough in design and applications of AI and other high-tech products with a view to fulfilling customers’ needs with professional solutions on high-tech products in areas of education, sports and living, etc. These high-tech products will generate fresh revenue streams for the Group in the years ahead and we believe that high-tech and gaming industry will merge more closely in future. Looking ahead, the Group will never rest on its laurels but will continue to acquire top talents and increase its investment in high-tech and avant-garde gaming products, aiming to explore more opportunities in the gaming technology space and expand its market share in global gaming industry. Nevertheless, we are cautious due to a range of geo-political and economic challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic which may impact consumer confidence in 2021. We remain confident in the longer-term outlook for Macau in general and believe that the Greater Bay Area integration plan will further facilitate the flow of people, logistics and capital within Macau, Hong Kong and the other cities of the Greater Bay Area and also other parts of the PRC. We will continue to support and leverage on the Greater Bay Area integration plan. The Group remains cautiously optimistic and will strive to identify new business opportunities in Macau and overseas markets and maximise returns to the Shareholders. The Group’s liquidity needs primarily comprise working capital including research and development expenditure, capital expenditure and repayment of bank borrowings. The Group has generally funded its operations from internal resources, bank and other borrowings and/or equity financing. The Group has adopted a prudent financial management approach towards its financial and treasury policies. During the year under review, the Group was on track with this approach to maintain a healthy liquidity position. The Board closely monitors the Group’s liquidity position to ensure that the liquidity structure of the Group’s assets, liabilities and other commitments can meet its funding requirements from time to time. The Group may utilise the balance of cash for appropriate investment in accordance with the Group’s strategic direction and development. As at 31 December 2020, the consolidated net assets of the Group amounted to HK$406.1 million, representing a decrease of HK$202.4 million or 33.3% from HK$608.5 million as at 31 December 2019. The decrease in consolidated net assets of the Group was mainly due to the Group’s loss of HK$192.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 and the payment of interim dividend by a non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to non-controlling interests for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of HK$7.1 million. As at 31 December 2020, the Group held pledged bank deposits of HK$30.3 million, bank balances and cash of HK$129.2 million and chips on hand of HK$13.5 million. The Group’s pledged bank deposits as at 31 December 2020 comprise a fixed deposit of HK$30.0 million (denominated in HK$, the Group’s functional currency, and placed at a Macau bank with original maturity of 12 months) and another fixed deposit of HK$0.3 million (denominated in Australian dollars and placed at an Australian bank with original maturity of 12 months). The Group’s other bank deposits were mainly denominated in HK$, MOP, Euro and US$. Given MOP is pegged to HK$ and HK$ are linked to US$, the Group considers that the exposure to exchange rate risk is normal for its bank deposits denominated in MOP and US$. Exchange rate of Euro against HK$ fluctuated during the year ended 31 December 2020. For accounting purposes, the Group’s bank deposits denominated in Euro were retranslated into HK$ at the exchange rate as at 31 December 2020 which resulted in a net unrealised exchange gain of approximately HK$5.7 million being recognised in the Group’s results for the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: nil). As at 31 December 2020, the Group had outstanding (i) secured and unguaranteed bank borrowings of approximately HK$137.0 million (2019: HK$145.8 million); and (ii) unsecured and unguaranteed amounts due to Directors of HK$1.6 million (2019: HK$2.1 million). The Group’s bank borrowings carried interest at prevailing market rates and were on floating rate basis. The bank borrowings were denominated in MOP and HK$. Given MOP is pegged to HK$, the Group considers the exposure to exchange rate risk normal for its bank borrowing denominated in MOP. The maturity profile of the bank borrowings of HK$137.0 million as at 31 December 2020 spread over a period of more than five years, with HK$9.0 million repayable within one year, HK$9.2 million in the second year, HK$29.0 million in the third to fifth years and HK$89.8 million over five years. The amounts due to Directors were interest-free and repayable on demand. The Group’s gearing ratio (expressed as a percentage of total borrowings over net assets) as at 31 December 2020 was 34.1% (2019: 24.3%). During the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group did not employ any financial instruments for hedging purposes. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had capital commitments in respect of acquisition of property, plant and equipment which is contracted for but not provided for of HK$1.1 million (31 December 2019: HK$1.1 million). The majority of the Group’s income and expenses, bank deposits and bank borrowings are denominated in HK$ (the Group’s functional currency), MOP, Euro and US$. HK$ are linked to US$ and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. MOP is pegged to HK$, and in many cases the two currencies are used interchangeably in Macau. Due to the stable exchange rates between HK$ and US$ and between HK$ and MOP, the Group does not consider that any specific hedge for fluctuation of MOP or US$ against HK$ is necessary. The Group has a net exchange exposure to Euro as it maintains certain bank deposits denominated in Euro. The Group manages its foreign currency risk of Euro against HK$ by closely monitoring the movement of the exchange rate and may consider specific hedge for significant foreign exchange exposure should additional need arise. As at 31 December 2020, leasehold land and buildings of the Group with the carrying amount of HK$214.7 million were pledged to secure bank borrowings offered by banks to the Group. In addition, as at 31 December 2020, the Group pledged bank fixed deposits of HK$30.3 million, comprising HK$30.0 million and HK$0.3 million to secure for guarantees in favour of SJM and a landlord (for fulfilment of all obligations of the related group company as tenant), respectively. The bank deposit of HK$30.0 million was placed at a bank as fixed deposit pledged to secure for a guarantee in the amount of HK$45.7 million issued by the bank for the period from 15 May 2020 to 30 June 2023 in favour of SJM for the Group’s fulfilment of all its obligations, in particular for reimbursement by the Group to SJM of the employees’ compensation and benefits for those gaming operation employees employed by SJM who work for the casino under the Group’s management, as stipulated under the service agreement (and all related supplemental agreements) entered into between SJM and the Group for provision of casino management services by the Group to SJM. As at 31 December 2020, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had approximately 770 employees, including approximately 380 gaming operation employees who were employed by SJM to work for Casino Kam Pek Paradise under the Group’s management. These gaming operation employees were paid by SJM and the Group reimbursed SJM in full for their salaries and other benefits. Total staff costs, including Directors’ emoluments, for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to HK$293.9 million (2019: HK$452.6 million), including a total of HK$137.4 million (2019: HK$265.9 million) paid or payable for gaming operation employees employed by SJM (for Casino Kam Pek Paradise) or Galaxy (for Casino Waldo). The terms of employment of employees conform to normal commercial practice. The remuneration policy for the employees of the Group is principally set up by the Board and the management of the Company on the basis of the relevant employees’ qualifications, competence, work performance, industry experience, relevant market trend and the Group’s operating results, etc. Discretionary bonuses are granted to employees based on merit and in accordance with industry practice. Other benefits including share options, share awards, retirement benefits, subsidised medical care, pension funds and training programmes are offered to eligible employees.

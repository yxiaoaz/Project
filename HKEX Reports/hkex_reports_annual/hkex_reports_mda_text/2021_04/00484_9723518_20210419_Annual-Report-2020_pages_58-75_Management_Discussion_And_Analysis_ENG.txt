In 2020, the Group endeavoured to meet the huge challenges caused by a changing global political and economic landscape as a result of the pandemic. On the basis of efforts to maintain the stability of existing businesses, the Group actively looked for business upgrade opportunities, explored new business areas, and identified new investment opportunities. The Group diversified the industry risks facing individual business with a diverse business portfolio, so as to actively respond to the pressure on existing businesses caused by the pandemic and dramatic changes in global economic and political conditions. Hit by the pandemic, the offline virtual reality (VR) game business operated by Beijing Xigua Huyu Technology Co., Ltd. ( ) (“Beijing Xigua”), which was previously owned by the Group, deteriorated significantly. The Group adopted decisive and proactive measures to successfully divest the loss-making offline VR game business during last year. This aimed to improve the Group’s financial position and enhance the value of its core assets, enabling the Group to focus its resources and strategies on other business areas with growth potential. In terms of online games, the Group continued to focus on optimizing the return on investment in its online game business. Through outsourcing cooperation with external professional teams, we will continue to maintain the operations of existing online games. This cooperation model will help us improve the cost efficiency of online games while maintaining the scale of revenue. In terms of the internet micro-credit business, taking into account the experience and lessons learnt from the past, combined with a series of adjustments and changes in China’s domestic policy environment and the increasingly tightening regulatory measures, the Group has adjusted the internet micro-credit business, halted the release of new loans, and proceeded to recover outstanding loans through active commercial and legal channels where the judgements of the related cases are in favour of the Group. The Group successfully acquired Shenzhen Xingyun Data Technology Co., Ltd. ( ) (“Shenzhen Xingyun”) during the year to further expand its business scope. Shenzhen Xingyun has been operating in the electronic device and semiconductor memory distribution and service industries for many years. Through providing customers with customized products and services in the hardware and software fields for semiconductor storage and other electronic devices, as well as integrated solutions supporting channel distribution, warehousing and logistics management, technical services, supply chain finance, etc., Shenzhen Xingyun has achieved sustained and stable business development. Supported by the fast growing electronic information industry and the rising semiconductor industry in China, Shenzhen Xingyun has developed rapidly in recent years, and is expected to continue to grow steadily driven by innovation and improvement of integrated service capabilities. The following table sets forth the Group’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2020 as compared to that for the year ended 31 December 2019. (Restated) Impairment of financial assets measured at Note: NM-Not meaningful. Revenue. Revenue decreased by approximately 38.5% to RMB60.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB98.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The following table sets forth the revenue of the Group by segment for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively: (% of Total Revenue) (% of Total Revenue) (Restated) Revenue generated from the Group’s game business decreased by approximately 48.3% to RMB29.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB57.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Revenue generated from the online games decreased mainly due to the fact that some of the Group’s key games such as the game “Liberators”, have entered into the mature stage of their lifecycles and generated less revenue than the previous year. Revenue generated from the Group’s internet micro-credit business decreased by approximately 83.1% to RMB6.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB40.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such decrease was mainly due to the Company’s transitional strategy to temporarily suspend the registration of new loans and recover the existing outstanding loans in order to reduce the overall risks associated with the internet micro-credit business for the year ended 31 December 2020. Revenue generated from the Group’s electronic device and semiconductor business was RMB23.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group completed the acquisition of Shenzhen Xingyun on 18 November 2020. The revenue of Shenzhen Xingyun mainly consisted of revenue generated from products and services offered to retail customers in the amount of RMB3.9 million, and revenue generated from products and services offered to business and industrial customers in the amount of RMB19.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was negative RMB49.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 while adjusted EBITDA was negative RMB74.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The following table sets forth the adjusted EBITDA of the Group by segment for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019: (Restated) Electronic device and semiconductor Note: The difference between the sum of adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s game business, internet micro-credit business and electronic device and semiconductor business above and the total adjusted EBITDA of the Group is derived from gain/(loss) on dilution of investments in an associate and share of (loss)/profits of associates. Note: NM-Not meaningful. Adjusted EBITDA in respect of the Group’s game business decreased to negative RMB28.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from negative RMB3.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The enlarged loss was primarily due to the decrease in game revenue and gross profit as some of the Group’s online games have entered into the mature stage of their lifecycles. Adjusted EBITDA in respect of the Group’s internet micro-credit business was negative RMB16.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 as compared to negative RMB88.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The improvement of adjusted EBITDA generated from the internet micro-credit business was mainly due to the substantially reduced impairment loss associated with the outstanding loan receivables, and partially offset by the decreased revenue of the internet micro-credit business. Adjusted EBITDA in respect of the Group’s electronic device and semiconductor business was RMB1.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, which was recognised during the period from 19 November 2020 to 31 December 2020. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased by approximately 70.3% to RMB40.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB23.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation of Shenzhen Xingyun into the Group’s business. Such increase was partially offset by the decrease in cost of revenue of the Group’s online games business in line with its revenue decrease. For the year ended 31 December 2020, the percentage of cost of revenue to total revenue increased to 67.2% (2019: 24.3%). Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately 47.4% to RMB4.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB9.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such decrease was in line with the decrease of revenue generated from the Group’s online game business. Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses increased by approximately 46.7% to RMB60.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 from RMB41.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such increase was primarily due to the reclassification of the business of Beijing Xigua as discontinued operations, which resulted in a decrease of the restated administrative expenses recognised in the continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2019. Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased from RMB21.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 to RMB0.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. Such decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of employees for the research and development department. Other income. Other income was RMB8.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 as compared to RMB23.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such decrease was primarily because no dividend was received from one of the companies invested by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020. Other gains/(losses) – net. The Group recognized other gains-net in the amount of RMB2.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to other losses-net in the amount of RMB5.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such change was primarily due to the change of fair value of investment at fair value through profit or loss. Share of (loss)/profits of associates. Share of loss of associates was RMB6.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, while share of profits of associates was RMB16.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such change was primarily due to the loss on investment generated from associated companies. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost for the year ended 31 December 2020 was RMB10.3 million, as compared to RMB137.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Such decrease was due to: (i) the impairment loss associated with the outstanding loan receivables of the internet micro- credit business was substantially reduced; and (ii) there was no impairment of proceeds receivables recorded from the disposal of the equity interest in JLC Inc. and its subsidiaries during the year ended 31 December 2020. Income tax (expense)/credit. The Group recognised income tax expense in the amount of RMB0.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, while the income tax credit was RMB4.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The income tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2019 was mainly associated with the deferred tax assets from one of the PRC subsidiaries of the Group recognised in 2019. Loss from continuing operations. The Group recognised loss from continuing operations in the amount of RMB51.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to RMB95.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The reduced loss was primarily attributable to the decrease in impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost. Loss from discontinued operations. The Group recognized loss from discontinued operations in the amount of RMB3.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as compared to RMB164.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The large reduction in loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to the fact that the discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2019 included the financial results of Jlc Inc. and its subsidiaries, which had been disposed of by the Group during 2019, as well as the financial results of Beijing Xigua, which had been disposed of by the Group in 2020. In contrast, the discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2020 only included the financial results of Beijing Xigua. To supplement the consolidated results of the Group which are prepared in accordance with IFRSs, certain non-IFRSs measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, have been presented. These non-IFRSs financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the measures of the Group’s financial performance which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs. The Group’s management believes that these non-IFRSs financial measures provide investors with useful supplementary information to assess the performance of its core operations by excluding certain non-cash and non-recurring items. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are unaudited figures. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the Group’s non-IFRSs financial measures for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively, to the nearest measures prepared in accordance with IFRSs: (Restated) Add: Depreciation and amortization Income tax expense/(credit) EBITDA (unaudited) Add: Share-based compensation Impairment of other receivables arising from disposal Changes in the value of investments at fair value Loss on transfer of investment in an associate to equity investments at fair value through other Loss on disposal of financial assets at fair value through Dividends received from equity investments at fair Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) As at 31 December 2020, the total equity of the Group amounted to RMB612.0 million as compared to that of RMB664.0 million as at 31 December 2019. Such decrease was primarily due to the operating loss recognised for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group’s net current assets amounted to RMB497.2 million as at 31 December 2020 as compared to that of RMB536.8 million as at 31 December 2019. The decrease in net current assets was a mixed effect of the decrease in current assets and the decrease in current liabilities, which was mainly due to the disposal of the VR game business operated by Beijing Xigua. The Group’s total cash, cash equivalent and short-term deposits amounted to RMB385.5 million as at 31 December 2020 as compared to that of RMB386.8 million as at 31 December 2019. The Group adopts a prudent cash and financial management policy. In order to achieve better cost control and minimise the cost of funding, the Group’s treasury activities are centralised and cash is generally deposited with banks and denominated mostly in RMB, followed by USD. As at 31 December 2020, the Group’s gearing ratio (calculated as bank borrowing divided by total assets) was nil (as at 31 December 2019: nil), which means that the Group did not have any bank borrowing balance as at 31 December 2020. The borrowing requirements of the Group are not subject to seasonality. As at 31 December 2020, RMB50.0 million of the financial resources of the Group (as at 31 December 2019: RMB45.7 million) was held as deposits denominated in non-RMB currencies. The Group will continue to actively manage its exposure to various foreign currencies and monitor its foreign exchange risk exposure to better preserve the Group’s cash value. Capital expenditures (excluding business combination) comprise the purchase of property and equipment, such as office equipment and leasehold improvement, and the purchase of intangible assets such as VR game licensing fee. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had a pledge of assets of RMB0.8 million (as at 31 December 2019: RMB1.0 million) as restricted cash for corporate credit card deposits. As at 31 December 2020, the Group did not have any significant unrecorded contingent liabilities (as at 31 December 2019: nil). During 2020, the Group held significant investments detailed as follows: As at 31 December 2020 Investment Registered Percentage of Ownership Interest Attributable to the Carry % to Total Assets of 23 February 2011 Chengdu Partnership Equity Investment Fund Partnership (Limited Partnership) 9 December 2013 (translated as Beijing Share Times Technology Co., Limited, “Share Times”) is a company that develops and operates intellectual properties (“IPs”) of celebrities including design, promotion, and sales of IPs. Share Times was recognized as investments in associates. In 2020, the Group recognised share of loss of associates of approximately RMB5.7 million and gain on dilution of investment in an associate of approximately RMB0.8 million from Share Times. The Group will continue to support the business development of Share Times, and seek synergy between Share Times and other investments of the Group to maximize their performances. ( ) (translated as Chengdu Partnership Equity Investment Fund Partnership (Limited Partnership), “Chengdu Partnership”) is an investment holding company. The investment in Chengdu Partnership was recognized as equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income in the Group’s financial position. The Group will continue to support the business development of Share Times and Chendu Partnership, and will continue to seek potential investment opportunities according to the Group’s development needs. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had 46 full-time employees (as at 31 December 2019: 615), the vast majority of whom are based in the PRC. For details of the Group’s remuneration policies and training schemes, share option schemes and restricted share unit scheme, please refer to the sections headed ”Remuneration Policy and Directors’ Remuneration”, “Pre-IPO Share Option Scheme” and “The Restricted Share Unit Scheme” contained in the Report of Directors in this annual report, respectively. References are made to the announcements of the Company dated 24 April 2019, 24 May 2019, 26 June 2019, 21 November 2019, 11 December 2019, 10 March 2020, 19 March 2020, 8 May 2020, 22 October 2020, 23 October 2020, 12 November 2020, 24 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 (collectively, the “Disposal Announcements”) and the circular of the Company dated 2 December 2020 (the “Circular”) in relation to the acquisition of Beijing Xigua, the non-fulfilment of the Profit Guarantee and the follow up actions taken by the Company. Unless otherwise stated herein, capitalized terms used in this section shall have the same meanings as those defined in the Disposal Announcements. On 24 April 2019, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Shanghai Dacheng, KongZhong and other relevant parties for the acquisition of 69.84% equity interest in Beijing Xigua in the form of the Subscription and the Equity Transfer. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the consideration for the acquisition was RMB20,000,000 in cash for the Subscription and RMB130,152,857 by way of allotment and issuance of 22,268,908 new Shares of the Company (the “Consideration Shares”) for the Equity Transfer. Under the Investment Agreement, Shanghai Dacheng, KongZhong and Beijing Xigua jointly and severally guaranteed and undertook to the Investor that the Actual Net Profits of Beijing Xigua for the guarantee periods would not be less than RMB43,000,000, RMB52,000,000 and RMB62,000,000. Completion of the acquisition took place on 26 June 2019. In addition, subsequent to completion of the acquisition, Guangzhou Feidong (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) granted a loan in the total amount of RMB32,300,000 to Beijing Xigua for the purpose of supporting its business. The loan was partially repaid in the sum of RMB4,222,200 by the other shareholders of Beijing Xigua, and Beijing Xigua was then still indebted to Guangzhou Feidong for the Outstanding Sum. Subsequently, due to the deteriorating operational performance of Beijing Xigua, it recorded an unaudited cumulative loss for the period from 1 June 2019 to 31 December 2019, and thus did not meet the Thresholds for such period of RMB43,000,000. As such, the Company originally elected to request for the Full Cash Compensation from Shanghai Dacheng, KongZhong and Beijing Xigua. The Company also requested repayment of the Outstanding Sum from Beijing Xigua. However, after multiple rounds of negotiations and discussions, during which the Company fully assessed the financial positions of Beijing Xigua and other relevant parties, the Company became aware of the difficulties in realizing the Full Cash Compensation. After careful and due deliberation and in an effort to protect and maximize the interests of the Company and the Shareholders as a whole, on 12 November 2020, the Company eventually entered into the Transfer Agreement, which involved the disposal of the 69.84% equity interest in Beijing Xigua in return for RMB20,000,000 in cash and 22,268,908 Consideration Shares to be repurchased and cancelled by the Company (i.e., the Equity Disposal and the Share Buy-back), and the assignment of the Outstanding Sum to KongZhong China in return for RMB5,519,280 in cash (i.e., the Loan Assignment). The proposed resolutions in relation to the Transfer Agreement was duly passed by the Independent Shareholders by way of poll during the EGM of the Company convened on 24 December 2020. Upon completion of the Equity Disposal in December 2020, Beijing Xigua has ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company and the Company no longer held any issued shares of Beijing Xigua. References are made to the announcements of the Company dated 22 October 2020, 13 November 2020, 18 November 2020 and 20 January 2021 in relation to the acquisition of the Target Company and Shenzhen Xingyun (collectively, the “Acquisition Announcements”). Unless otherwise stated herein, capitalized terms used in this section shall have the same meanings as those defined in the Acquisition Announcements. On 22 October 2020, the Company announced the acquisition of the Target Company and Shenzhen Xingyun through its wholly-owned subsidiary Foga Tech Limited, the Consideration of the Acquisition was RMB24,000,000. On 13 November 2020 (after trading hours), the Company announced that the relevant parties have entered into the Supplemental SPA pursuant to which the payment terms shall be amended as a combination of cash payment in the amount of RMB6,000,000 and the remaining payment by allotment and issuance of 9,614,760 Consideration Shares under the General Mandate. The Issue Price of the Consideration Shares was HK$2.19 per Consideration Share. On 18 November 2020, the Company announced the Completion of the Acquisition as all conditions precedent under the Sale and Purchase Agreement have been fulfilled. The Target Company and Shenzhen Xingyun have thus become indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Shenzhen Xingyun is engaged in the sales of digital storage devices to corporate and individual users in the PRC. Despite the adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, Shenzhen Xingyun reported growth in 2020 driven by the steady demand for digital storage devices in the PRC and its increasingly stable business partnership with leading e-commerce providers. Upon Completion of the Acquisition, the Company took the opportunity to tap into the digital storage devices business in the PRC, which is expected to benefit the Group in diversifying its business portfolio and contributing to the financial performance of the Group on a long-term perspective. References are made to the Acquisition Announcements. On 20 January 2021, the Company announced the completion of the allotment and issuance of the Consideration Shares under the General Mandate, as well as the payment of the Cash Consideration in the amount of RMB6,000,000, in relation to the Acquisition of the Target Company and Shenzhen Xingyun. References are made to the Disposal Announcements. On 19 February 2021, the Company announced the completion of off-market Share Buy-back in relation to the disposal of the 69.84% equity interest in Beijing Xigua. Reference is made to the announcement of the Company dated 6 April 2021 in relation to the acquisition of the Target Company and Shenzhen Binghong. Unless otherwise stated herein, capitalized terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as those defined in the announcement of the Company dated 6 April 2021. On 6 April 2021, the Company announced the entering into of the SPA with the Vendor, the Guarantors and relevant parties for the acquisition of (i) the Sale Shares, representing the entire issued share capital of the Target Company; and (ii) the Sale Loan in the sum of approximately RMB52.1 million. The aggregate consideration of the Purchase is approximately RMB92.1 millon including the Consideration Cash of approximately RMB63.0 million and the Consideration Shares in the amount of approximately RMB29.1 million (equivalent to approximately HK$35.0 millon) through allotment and issuance of an aggregate of 18,208,768 Consideration Shares at the Issue Price of HK$1.92 per Consideration Share. The Target Group is engaged in providing commercial factoring and private securities fund management services. Shenzhen Binghong Commercial Factoring is a commercial factoring service provider. Shenzhen Sijia Capital is a private equity investment company that can provide private equity services in the PRC. The Board believes that the Target Group will continue to capture the growth opportunities in the commercial factoring and asset management services industry in the PRC and contribute to the financial performance of the Group. The Purchase constitutes a major and connected transaction of the Company under Chapter 14 and Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules and is subject to the reporting, announcement, circular and independent shareholder’s approval requirements under the Listing Rules. An EGM will be convened and held to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Purchase. Shareholders and potential investors should note that the Purchase is subject to a number of conditions which may or may not be fulfilled. Shareholders and potential investors of the Company are reminded to exercise caution when dealing in the Shares and securities of the Company. The Group is exposed to a number of risks including macroeconomic and external risks common to most industries, as well as risks specific to the industries in which the Group operates. The Group has formulated policies to ensure continuous identification, reporting, monitoring and management of significant risks that may adversely affect its business development. As to its established online legacy game business, the Group is mainly exposed to the following types of risks: (i) the risk of declines in current game revenue and profitability. Due to the life cycle of online games, changes in player preferences may cause uncertainties around the Company’s future business performance; (ii) the risk of loss of core talents. The loss of key management members and technical personnel may adversely affect the Company’s operations; (iii) industry regulatory risks. China has strict regulations and policy controls on games, and the online game industry is subject to the supervision of various authorities. Any failure of the Company to consistently obtain its licence from the authorities may have an adverse impact on its business operations; and (iv) platform and technology risks, which may hamper the Group’s ability to collect fees and data and update games. As to the electronic device and semiconductor business of Shenzhen Xingyun, the Group is mainly exposed to the following types of risks: (i) exchange risk. Since the Group’s operations involve settlement in US dollars, it is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates of the currency; and (ii) inventory management risk. Due to the high value of semiconductor memory products, their prices are volatile and vulnerable to macroeconomic cyclicity. Improper inventory management may cause capital occupancy, leading to financial risks. The main risks associated with the remaining internet micro-credit business of the Group are: (i) the credit risk of loans becoming unrecoverable; and (ii) the collapse of real estate market or other markets causing the decrease in the value of the collaterals granted to the Group. All of the above may have an adverse effect on the Group’s performance. In addition, the Group is exposed to risks such as impairment loss due to invested companies’ under-performance or contract party becoming insolvent, other unexpected one-off restructuring costs, and failures of certain material litigations or arbitrations, all of which will have an adverse effect on the Group’s performance. Since the start of 2020, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has struck a heavy blow to the growth of global economy, and of all industries. Under the new normal shaped by the pandemic, in order to better cope with the risks brought by the economic downturn to its business, the Group has made a series of operating adjustments and successfully divested the offline VR game business operated by Beijing Xigua. As to the internet micro-credit business, the Group accelerated loan collection and ceased to release new loans in response to the changing environment and industry in China. As of March 2021, the Group has completed the change of company name, business scope and registered capital among others for its main domestic operating company Yunke (formerly known as Jiujiang Yunke Internet Microfinance Co., Ltd., “Yunke”). After completion of the change, Yunke will continue to recover the outstanding loans granted. At the same time, Yunke will engage in internet information technology services and consulting related businesses based on its existing internet technologies and platforms. The management is of the view that such action will help the Company to improve its operating level, integrate existing resources for strategic expansion and business extension, and vigorously carry out high value-added financial services business such as supply chain financing services. Looking ahead, the Group will ride on the changing environment and market trends, continue to steadily develop existing businesses, improve operating efficiency, practice cost control and improve cost management, so as to comprehensively improve the return on its assets. At the same time, the Group will keep an eye on the development of the market and the industry, and explore a development model suitable for it with an open mind and innovative thinking based on past experience and lessons. The Group will actively seek to expand and transform its business, optimise its business structure and improve management efficiency based on a perspective of sustainable development, in an effort to create ideal returns for its shareholders.

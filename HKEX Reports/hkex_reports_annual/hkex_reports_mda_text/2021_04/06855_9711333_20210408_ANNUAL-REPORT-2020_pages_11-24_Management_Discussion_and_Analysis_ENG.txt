We are a globally-focused, clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in developing novel therapies for cancers, hepatitis B virus, or HBV, and age-related diseases. Leveraging our technical expertise in structure-based drug design and our innovative drug discovery engine, we have developed a robust pipeline of eight clinical stage small molecule drug candidates. Our pipeline consists of novel small molecule drug candidates that disrupt complex and difficult-to-target PPIs, and next generation TKIs. Our Core Product, HQP1351, is a third generation BCR-ABL inhibitor targeting a broad spectrum of BCR-ABL mutants, including those with the T315I mutation. Our PPI drug candidates are intended to treat cancer and other diseases by restoring the normal function of key intrinsic apoptotic pathways, including the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, MDM2-p53 and IAP pathways, which play a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis. We are also developing several next generation TKIs to treat diseases with high unmet medical needs. Our compounds are being developed for use as a single agent or in combination with other therapies. As of December 31, 2020, we are conducting more than 30 Phase I or II clinical trials to evaluate our eight drug candidates in the United States, Australia and China. In addition, we are developing and implementing biomarker strategies in our drug discovery with the goal of improving the success rates of our clinical trials. We have a pipeline of eight clinical stage small molecule drug candidates. The following table summarizes our pipeline and the development status of each candidate as at December 31, 2020: Annual Report 2020 During the Reporting Period, we have made significant progress with respect to our product pipeline: Our Core Product, HQP1351 (Olverembatinib), is a third generation BCR-ABL inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL mutants, including those with the T315I mutation. With the “one-time umbrella approval” of HQP1351 in China, HQP1351 is currently under development as monotherapy for treatment of patients with TKI resistant CML with or without T315I mutation. The HQP1351 NDA was submitted to National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China in June 2020, and was accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) under the NMPA with “Priority Review” status based on the results of two pivotal phase II clinical studies, for the treatment of patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant and with T315I- mutant chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and accelerated phase CML in October 2020. HQP1351 has been included in the list of the commercialization application made in China if the application is approved, HQP1351 will be the first marketed third generation BCR-ABL inhibitor in China. The third pivotal study in CML patients who are resistant/ intolerant to 1st and 2nd generation TKIs is ongoing, the enrollment of this study will be completed in the first half of 2021. In addition, a Phase Ib clinical trial for the treatment of patients with TKI resistant CML and Philadelphia Chromosome positive ALL (Ph + ALL) with or without T315I mutations is ongoing in the United States. Preliminary data have demonstrated that HQP1351 is efficacious on treatments of these CML patients who are TKI resistant including resistant or failed to Ponatinib. Furthermore, FDA has granted HQP1351 an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of CML and a Fast Track Designation for the treatment of CML with certain genetic markers who have failed to respond to treatments with existing TKIs in April 2020. Data from the clinical trial showed that HQP1351 has achieved significant antitumor activity in TKI resistant CML patients with favorable safety profile. The positive data from pivotal Phase II clinical studies of HQP1351 (Olverembatinib) was present orally at the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2020. This is the third consecutive time in which clinical progress of HQP1351 was selected for oral presentation at the ASH Annual Meetings since 2018. Cautionary Statement required by Rule 18A.08(3) of the Listing Rules: WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET HQP1351 SUCCESSFULLY. APG-2575 is a novel, orally administrated Bcl-2 selective inhibitor developed to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies by selectively blocking Bcl-2 to restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells. APG-2575 had received clearances and approvals for multiple Phase Ib/II clinical studies in China, United States, Australia and Europe, and is currently being clinically developed in a range of hematologic malignancies globally. Total 13 Phase I/II clinical studies are ongoing globally, with over 150 subjects who have been treated with APG-2575 as a single agent at doses ranging from 20 mg to 1200 mg. APG- 2575 is also the first made-in-China Bcl-2 selective inhibitor to enter clinical trials in China. The patients enrolled include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL),and Hairy cell leukemia (HCL), etc. More than 50 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (r/r CLL) have been treated with APG-2575. Preliminary results have showed that an objective response rate (ORR) of more than 70% has been reached in the evaluable patients. No DLT (dose limited toxicity) has been reported and the maximum tolerated does (MTD) has not been reached, even in 1200mg dose level, which shows that APG-2575 has a much better safety profile in the same class drug. Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were of Grade 1 or 2. Limited cases of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were reported. In addition, we entered a global clinical collaboration with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development center of excellence of AstraZeneca to evaluate the combination of APG-2575 with acalabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor in patients with R/R CLL/SLL in June 2020. Furthermore, FDA has granted five Orphan Drug Designations (ODDs) on APG-2575 for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APG-1252 is a novel, highly potent, small molecule drug designed to restore apoptosis through selective inhibition of the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and myelofibrosis. A total of 135 patients have been treated with APG-1252. We are currently conducting three Phase I dose-escalation/ expansion trials in patients with advanced cancers in the United States Australia and China, respectively. APG-1252 is also being tested in a variety of combination trials including a Phase Ib/II study of APG-1252 plus paclitaxel in patients with SCLC in the United States and Australia, a Phase Ib/II study of APG-1252 plus ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis in the United States, and a Phase Ib study of APG-1252 plus osimertinib in patients with NSCLC in China. Furthermore, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted APG-1252 an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in October 2020. APG-115 is an orally bioavailable, highly selective, small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 PPI. APG-115 was designed to activate p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 interaction. APG-115 is the first MDM2-p53 inhibitor entering clinical stage in China, with multiple ongoing clinical studies in treating solid tumors as well as hematological tumors in China, the United States, and Australia. We are currently enrolling three clinical trials of APG-115 in the United States, a Phase Ib/II study in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of metastatic melanoma and other advanced solid tumors, in collaboration with Merck, a Phase I/II combination with chemo in AML, and a Phase I/II study as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of salivary gland cancer. APG-115 is the first MDM2-p53 inhibitor to enter clinical stage in China with a Phase Ib/II study as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of AML or MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome). In addition, The Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has granted clinical approval for a Phase Ib/II clinical study of APG-115 in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with advanced liposarcoma (LPS) or other advanced solid tumors, as well as approved a clinical study of APG-115, as a single agent or in combination with the APG-2575, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (R/R T-PLL). This study will also enroll in the USA. In addition, in 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted APG-115 four Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, for the treatment gastric cancer(GC), the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for the Retinoblastoma. Annual Report 2020 APG-1387 is a novel, small molecule inhibitor of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, or IAP proteins, that we are developing for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and chronic HBV infection. APG-1387 is the first IAP-targeting drug to enter clinical trials in China and has completed the Phase I clinical trials as a single agent in solid tumors in Australia and China. We are currently conducting a Phase I clinical trial in the United States, testing combination of APG-1387 with pembrolizumab (“Keytruda”), an anti-PD-1 mAb in solid tumors and the preliminary result was released in ASCO meeting in May 2020. Meanwhile, in China, a Phase Ib/II clinical trial testing the combination of APG-1387 with toripalimab ( ), another anti-PD-1 mAb in solid tumors is ongoing. A Phase Ib/II clinical trial of APG-1387 in combination with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer is in initiation. In addition, 2 clinical trials of APG-1387 in Hepatitis B disease area are ongoing. The Phase I trial of single agent APG1387 in treatment naive Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) patients has completed the treatment and follow-up in the monotherapy regimen. With the positive preliminary result, the extension of the Phase I study with APG-1387 sequentially combo with NAs in treatment naive CHB patients is ongoing. A Phase II clinical trial of APG-1387 concurrently combo with nucleic acids in CHB patients is ongoing as well. As at December 31, 2020, a total of 176 patients were enrolled and treated in the studies. Mcl-1 inhibitors AS00491 and APG-3526 Mcl-1 is another important member of the Bcl-2 family proteins that regulate apoptosis. Mcl-1 is in one of the top 10 most frequently amplified gene regions for cancer. Overexpression of Mcl-1 contributes to the evasion of apoptosis and is one of the major resistance mechanisms for many types of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, including venetoclax. Mcl-1 mediates its effects primarily through interactions with pro-apoptotic BH3-containing proteins, and traditionally it has been a difficult target for drug development in the PPI field. Currently, there are two Mcl-1 inhibitors in active clinical trials. We have discovered multiple lead compounds of Mcl-1 inhibitors using PPI platform, including AS00491 and APG-3526, which exhibit high binding affinity to Mcl-1 and anti-proliferative activity in cell-based assays. In xenograft model studies in vivo, AS00491 and APG-3526 exerted significant antitumor activity in human AML MV-411 and MM NCI-929 and OPM- 2 models. Treatment with these lead compounds led to equivalent or more potent antitumor activity compared with the reference agent AZD-5991 in human AML and MM xenograft models. CR was achieved after a single intravenous administration of AS00491 or APG-3526. The pharmacodynamics (PD) study using tumor samples further revealed caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage triggered by APG-3526, which disrupts MCL-1:BIM (Bcl-2-like protein 11) complex thus freeing BIM to initiate the apoptotic cascade. EED inhibitor APG-5918 APG-5918 has been nominated as the clinical candidate targeting EED in April 2020, marking the entrance of the program into the IND-enabling stage. APG-5918 is a potent, orally available, and selective EED inhibitor with the best-in-class potential. APG-5918 demonstrated substantial activities in both biochemical and cell-based assays, as well as impressive antitumor activity in xenograft tumor models in mice. In addition, APG-5918 showed overall favorable DMPK, TOX and physicochemical properties. Allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor AS1266 After the 3rd generation BCR-ABL inhibitor HQP1351 targeting T315I mutation, the company developed AS1266, a fourth generation BCR-ABL inhibitor. AS1266 binds to an allosteric pocket unique to BCR-ABL fusion protein. AS1266 is highly a selective, unique inhibitor, leading to enhanced activity and offering the potential for overcoming acquired drug resistance conferred by additional mutations. Indeed, AS1266 in combination with classical TKIs including HQP1351 shows synergic effect in cells expressing various drug resistant mutations. KRAS G12C covalent inhibitor APG-1842 The Company has developed multiple classes of highly potent KRAS G12C mutant specific inhibitors, lead compounds have demonstrated potent in vitro activity against cancer cells with mutated KRAS G12C. It has demonstrated excellent oral pharmacokinetics, robust antitumor activity in animal models. The Company entered into an agreement with the University of Michigan through which the Company shall obtain the exclusive global rights to a MDM2 protein degrader developed the Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) technology. The molecule is well tolerated in mice, rats and dogs; has excellent pharmacokinetics in rodents and non-rodents. We have a proven track record of researching, developing and commercializing biopharmaceuticals. We plan to continue to diversify and expand our product pipeline through both in-house research and development and through collaboration with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic institutions. We have an experienced scientific advisory board, chaired by Dr. Wang Shaomeng, our co-founder and non-executive Director. Members of our scientific advisory board are renowned scientists with expertise in cancer research and development. They are not our employees but will from time to time provide us with assistance upon our request. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our research and development expenses were RMB463.9 million and RMB564.6 million, respectively. Intellectual property rights are fundamental to our business. Through our robust research and development, we have strategically developed a global intellectual property portfolio with exclusive licenses to issued patents or patent applications worldwide with respect to our product candidates. As at December 31, 2020, we had 110 issued patents and more than 450 patent applications globally, among of which, about 90 patents had been issued overseas. In addition to our strong in-house research and development team, we have established global collaboration relationships with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. In June 2020, we have entered into a global clinical collaboration with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development center of excellence of AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN). We will sponsor a clinical trial to study the combination of APG-2575, and Acerta Pharma’s CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib), a BTK inhibitor, evaluating the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy in patients with r/r CLL/SLL. In July 2020, we entered into a global clinical collaboration with MSD to evaluate the combination of APG-115 and Keytruda for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. We have commenced three clinical trials of APG-115 in the United States, including a Phase I study as single agent, a Phase Ib/II study in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of metastatic melanoma and other advanced solid tumors, and a Phase I/II study as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of salivary gland cancer. Furthermore, we signed a strategic cooperation agreement with China National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Diseases on the joint construction of the “National Hematological Diseases Clinical Medical Research Center” to promote the research and clinical development in this field in July 2020. In December 2020, we received milestone payment from our global strategic cooperation partner, UNITY Biotechnology according to the licensing agreement entered into between Ascentage Pharma and UNITY of drug candidate UBX1325, a drug developed from BM-962, a Bcl-xL inhibiting compound licensed to UNITY by Ascentage Pharma for the treatment of age-related diseases. Annual Report 2020 We believe our global collaboration network provides us with global endorsement and enhances our brand recognition. Our collaborations also lead to better access to leading drugs and candidates and potentially offer an extra funding source to advance our product development. We lease an approximately 4,480 square meter facility for research and development and manufacturing in China Medical City, Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, the PRC, where we produce and supply pre-clinical test articles and clinical trial materials for some of our drug candidates. In addition, we expect to construct an approximately 100,000 square meter facility in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, the PRC for R&D and manufacturing (the “Suzhou Facility”). In November 2019, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Suzhou Facility was held at the Suzhou Industrial Park. At the Suzhou Facility, we intend to produce drug product for clinical or, in the future, commercial use. The Suzhou Facility is expected to consist of two oral-solid-dosage production lines, for both tablet and capsule formulations, and two parenteral liquid/lyophilization powder-for-injection production lines. Our own China-based global R&D center and manufacturing facility has completed the construction of the structure by January 2021 and should be commissioned in 2021. The Company expects that even though vaccines have begun to be distributed, the Company’s global operations, including clinical trial recruitment and participation, regulatory interactions, drug supply and manufacturing and R&D facility construction, will continue to be negatively impacted depending on the scope and duration of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (“COVID-19”). In addition, it is not certain if the jurisdictions where we operate will maintain or further extend any of the current restrictions or if further restrictive measures will be put into place. Because of the spread of the COVID-19 globally to countries outside of China, there have been significant restrictions on domestic and international air and ground travel. Many businesses and governments have imposed quarantine policies. The potential economic impact caused by the COVID-19, both in general and in particular, in the Chinese and United States and other global economies, may be difficult to assess or predict, and its actual effects will depend on various factors beyond our control. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and will operate our clinical trials in compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize delays and disruptions which may have an impact on our ability to deliver our clinical and regulatory goals in 2021. Facing the severe novel coronavirus pandemic, Ascentage Pharma proactively fulfilled its social responsibility by donating RMB500,000 to Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Tongji Hospital in January 2020, for their procurement of relevant protective equipment and other urgently needed medical supplies to combat the pandemic. Meanwhile, Ascentage Pharma also took the initiative to organize procurement of supplies, spending a total amount of RMB500,000 to purchase urgently needed medical supplies, including N95 masks, protective clothing, safety goggles and other medical supplies, from the United States, which were delivered to various hospitals in Wuhan. Through our connection with various parties, we made use of the voluntary donation of RMB100,000 from our employees to purchase medical disposable protective clothing. We successfully purchased 400 protective clothing, which was delivered directly to Peking University People’s Hospital in March 2020 to help combat the pandemic.

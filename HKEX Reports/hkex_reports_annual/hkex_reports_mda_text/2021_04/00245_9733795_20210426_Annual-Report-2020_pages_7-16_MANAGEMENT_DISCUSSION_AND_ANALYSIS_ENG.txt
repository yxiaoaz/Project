In 2020, the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the prevention measures at different government delivered a rare economic shock to major economies, with the exception of China, which achieved 2.3% economic growth. China’s economy also plunged 6.8% in the first quarter, but recovered quickly thanks to the effective prevention and control of the pandemic, continued expansion of monetary credit, and fiscal expansion in the form of tax cuts and subsidies. At the same time, China became the world’s logistic base during the pandemic with its strong supply, thus able to filling the global supply gap and maintaining strong exports. Given these factors, beyond expectation economic growth was achieved. Amid the pandemic, the financial market experienced severe volatility in the first quarter. As a result, the world’s major economies, led by the United States, embarked on sizable quantitative easing to aggressively stimulate the economy, creating established fiscal policy and making debt monetization a norm. The effect of these policies on restoring financial market stability in the short term is obvious. As the Federal Reserve implemented a series of bailout measures, the stock market, bond market and money market partially regained stability and resumed normal operation from late March to mid-April, and the liquidity crisis was eased, bringing to the global bullish market after the second quarter. The Chinese stock market also benefited from the government’s policy on supporting direct financing market, which ignited the bull market since the containment of the pandemic in the second quarter. In 2020, the competition between the US and China reflects the characteristics of all-encompassing and globalization. As the impact of the pandemic expanded, the rivalry between the US and China extended across various fields including values, economic, cultural, technological, security areas and other aspects, and their influence further spread and broadened their global reach through ideological propaganda. Hong Kong’s economy faced significant impact from the pandemic in terms of consumer consumption and tourism, with overall investment expenditure plunging further, resulting in the 6.1% record year on year drop in GDP, while the unemployment rate rose to 7% and retail sales plunged 24.3%, the largest yearly decline on record.

In terms of IPO markets, global IPO financing activities reached a ten-year high, with IPO fund raising increased by 42% over 2019 to US$331 billion. 2020’s top five exchanges in terms of fund raising were NYSE, NASDAQ, HKEx, SSE and SZSE. Of which: A-share IPO fund raising increased by 77% over 2019 to US$64 billion; the number of IPO deals increased by 81% to 365, up from 202 in 2019. Meanwhile, the global top 10 IPO projects such as the JD.com , JD Health and NetEase were listed on the HKEx, driving a significant 26% increase in Hong Kong IPO fund raising as compared to In terms of the bond market, the downward economic trend presents relatively certain market opportunities. In 2020, benefiting from the Federal Reserve’s easing programme and fewer available outstanding investment targets, the Chinese USD bond issuance and subscription market remained active, with 616 new issuances and a total issuance size of US$203.36 billion, which basically remained at the same level as in 2019. The amount of real estate enterprises issuance was US$61.22 billion in 2020, down 15.8% year-on-year. The amount of urban investment issuance was US$18.15 billion, down 32.6% year-on-year.

The Group’s research and development expenses remained largely the same with a slight increase of 1.1% from approximately RMB330.8 million in 2019 to approximately RMB334.4 million in 2020. The increase was primarily because the Company increased its investment in creating a product matrix and its research and development investment in technologies and products. As a percentage of the Group’s revenue, research and development expenses decreased from 10.1% in 2019 to 6.8% in 2020. The Group’s other gains – net decreased by 41.3% from approximately RMB69.7 million in 2019 to approximately RMB40.9 million in 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in loss for claims and legal proceedings and the fair value loss of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The Group’s other income remained largely the same with a slight decreased by 1.4% from approximately RMB83.9 million in 2019 to approximately RMB82.7 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in tax based subsidies and partially offset by a decrease in other government subsidies the Group received from local governments.

The profit mainly came from the investment income of the associates and the joint ventures of the Group.

The Group’s income tax expenses increased by 28.1% from approximately RMB7.9 million in 2019 to approximately RMB10.2 million in 2020, primarily due to the increase in the profit before income tax in 2020. As a result of the foregoing, the Group recorded a profit for the year of approximately RMB203.2 million in 2020, representing an increase of 285.0% from approximately RMB52.8 million in 2019. To supplement the Group’s consolidated annual financial statements which are presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the Group also uses adjusted net profit (“Adjusted Net Profit”) as an additional financial measure. The Group’s Adjusted Net Profit eliminates the effect of non-cash share-based compensation expenses. The table below sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Profit for the years indicated: Add: non-cash share-based compensation expenses(1) Adjusted Net Profit(2) Refers to share-based compensation benefits provided to certain employees via the employee share scheme. To supplement our consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with IFRS, we also use Adjusted Net Profit as an additional financial measure. We present this financial measure because it is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. We also believe that this non-IFRS measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Adjusted Net Profit is calculated using profit for the year, and add back non-cash share-based compensation expenses. The term of Adjusted Net Profit is not defined under IFRS. The use of Adjusted Net Profit has material limitations as an analytical tool, as it does not include all items that impact our net profit for the year.

Generally, the Company had in the past selected short-term financial products issued by reputable commercial banks that had relatively low associated risk. Prior to making an investment, the Company had also ensured that it would remain sufficient working capital for the Group’s business needs, operating activities and capital expenditures even after making the investments in such financial products. These financial products were considered to have relatively low risk and are also in line with the internal risk management, cash management and investment policies of the Group. The Company had, in the past, entirely recovered the principal and received the expected returns upon the redemption or maturity of similar financial products. In addition, these financial products were with flexible redemption terms or a relatively short term of maturity. In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, these financial products are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. In view of an upside of earning a more attractive return than current saving or fixed deposit rate under the low interest rate trend, as well as the low risk nature and the flexible redemption terms or a relatively short term of maturity of the wealth management products, the directors of the Company (the “Directors”) are of the view that these financial products pose little risk to the Group and the terms and conditions of each of the subscriptions are fair and reasonable and are in the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Company believes that the above investment strategies and directions would continue to generate stable income to the Group. In 2020, the Group’s capital expenditure amounted to approximately RMB8.0 million (2019: approximately RMB11.7 million), which was mainly used for the acquisition of property, equipment, leasehold improvements and intangible assets. The Group funded its capital expenditure by using the cash flow generated from its operations. As at 31 December 2020, the Group did not have any significant unrecorded contingent liabilities, guarantees or any litigation against the Group except for that disclosed in the cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash section. As at 31 December 2020, the Group did not pledge any assets. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Group entities’ functional currency. The functional currency of the Company is USD and the functional currency of subsidiaries operated in the PRC is Renminbi. The Group manages its foreign exchange risk by performing regular reviews of the Group’s net foreign exchange exposures and tries to minimise these exposures through natural hedges, wherever possible, and may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, when necessary. As at 31 December 2020, the Group had a total of 1,627 full time employees, mainly located in mainland China. In particular, 337 employees are responsible for the Group’s business operations, 20 for sales and marketing, 200 for content monitoring, 65 for customer service, 865 for technology, research and development, and 140 for general and administrative functions.

On 15 March 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which has come into effect on 1 January 2020 and replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in the PRC, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign- invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law has unified the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments and by way of having a Negative List. Annual Report 2020 The Negative List, which has been issued by the State Council, refers to special administrative measures for access to foreign investment in specific fields in the PRC. A foreign investor shall not invest in any field prohibited from foreign investment under the Negative List. A foreign investor shall meet the investment conditions stipulated under the Negative List for any restricted fields under the Negative List. A foreign investor who invests in a foreign-invested value-added telecommunications enterprise operating value-added telecommunications businesses in the PRC must demonstrate a good track record and experience in operating value- added telecommunications businesses (the “Qualification Requirement”). Moreover, foreign investors that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People’s Republic of China and the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, or their authorised local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals, for the commencement of that investor’s value-added telecommunications businesses in the PRC. There have been no updates to the Foreign Investment Law and the Group’s compliance with the Foreign Investment Law and the implementation rules in relation to the Qualification Requirement since the Listing Date and up to the date of this annual report.

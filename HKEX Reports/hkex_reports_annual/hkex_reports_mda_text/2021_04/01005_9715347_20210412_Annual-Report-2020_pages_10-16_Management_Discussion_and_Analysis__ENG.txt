Amid the COVID-19 economic influence, social distancing and soaring unemployment suppressed consumer spending, the main growth engine, were set to decline despite fiscal measures designed to mitigate the damage during the year. Despite the improvement in economic activity in the third quarter, the pace of growth eased in fourth quarter due to base effects as well as election uncertainty and rising cases of COVID-19. The United States saw a historically wide fiscal deficit as policymakers ramp up spending in an attempt to mitigate the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Group recorded a decrease in sales from Original Equipment Manufacturing, Original Brand Manufacturing (“OBM”) outdoor products of “Gazillion ® Bubbles” and lighting products. However, due to the robust growth for cross-border e-commerce sales, the sales from mass-market retailers for Original Design Manufacturing (“ODM”) products under new brands improved.

That said, the renewed domestic lockdown and travel restrictions, as well as stem from lingering economic scarring from lost jobs and income tempered the pace of the recovery. Notwithstanding, the sales from the Group’s mass-market retailers in respect of toy car products, OBM outdoor game products of “Gazillion ® Bubbles” and girls’ toy series products increased. As a whole, the revenue generated from the Canadian market recorded an increase. The Group will make efforts to maintain its existing distributors and clients, such as Wal-Mart, Toys “R” US and Costco Canada. Our revenue in Europe decreased by approximately HK$34,653,000 or 30.6% to approximately HK$78,650,000 for the year from approximately HK$113,303,000 last year.

Our revenue in the Australia and New Zealand markets decreased by approximately HK$1,045,000 or 2.7% to approximately HK$37,062,000 for the year from approximately HK$38,107,000 last year.

In 2011, the Group acquired 7 city gas projects from its controlling shareholder in addition to its acquisition of other 18 new PRC city gas distribution projects. The results of these 7 city gas projects are accounted for in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with Accounting Guideline 5 “Merger Accounting under Common Control Combination” adopted by the Group. Accordingly, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the two years ended 31st December, 2010 and 2011 include the results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows of the companies now comprising the Group as if the current group structure had been in existence throughout the two years ended 31st December, 2010 and 2011, or since their respective dates of incorporation or establishment where this is a shorter period except for the subsidiaries acquired from independent third parties and the jointly controlled entities acquired, which are included in the consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisitions. To enable the management and discussion analysis be more meaningful in presenting the changes from 2010 to 2011, only the financial and operational numbers before restatement for 2010 are discussed in the analysis below. The Group’s results for 2011 were driven by both organic and acquisition growths. The Group’s turnover for the year amounted to HK$13,507 million (2010: HK$8,327 million). The city gas distribution business contributed an after tax but before non-controlling interest profit of HK$1,596 million (2010: HK$970 million) and profit attributable to shareholders of HK$1,200 million (2010: HK$734 million). The net cash inflow from operations during the year amounted to HK$2,110 million (2010: HK$1,502 million). The Group spent HK$454 million in capital expenditure during the year (2010: HK$4.3 billion) to fund its acquisition expansion (excluding the HK$1.93 billion acquisition by share consideration) and HK$1.51 billion in upgrading of its continuing city gas distribution business (2010: HK$1.38 billion). The above required funding was financed by the operating cash flow, bank borrowings and cash on hand of the Group. As at year end, the Group’s free cash on hand was HK$6.9 billion (2010: HK$6.5 billion). Among the cash balance 16% was denominated in Hong Kong dollar and the remaining in Renminbi and US dollar. It is the Group’s policy to use the cash flow generated from operations and appropriate level of borrowings as the principal source of fund to finance major expansion and acquisition. As at the end of the year, the Group has total borrowings of HK$6.5 billion. 24% of the borrowings are considered as current liabilities and repayable within one year, the remaining are repayable in five years. Renminbi and HK dollar denominated borrowings accounted for 10% and 90% of the total borrowings respectively. Over 90% of the borrowings are interest bearing bank loans on floating rate terms. The cash balance of the Group was HK$6.9 billion as at the year end. The gearing ratio of the Group at the end of the year, calculated as total borrowings over total assets, was 26% (2010: 29%). The EBITDA to interest cover ratio was at the healthy level of 35.3 times. The financial position and liquidity of the Group is very healthy and stable. The Group has been granted a total of HK$6.7 billion term loan facilities with maturities from 2012 to 2016. The facilities are unsecured and with floating interest rates. As at the end of the year, 88% of the facilities has been drawn down. The facilities together with healthy operating cash flow will provide sufficient funding for foreseeable expansion and working capital requirement. Other than the above mentioned committed facilities, the Group has no other committed borrowing facilities. For day-to-day liquidity management and maintaining flexibility in funding, the Group has managed to obtain sufficient uncommitted short-term facilities from banks. As at 31st December, 2011, a bank deposit of HK$18 million was pledged as securities for trade payable to a supplier of natural gas and certain property, plant and equipment and trade receivables with carrying values of HK$213 million were pledged to secure bank borrowings. During the year ended 31st December, 2011, the Group’s city gas distribution business spent HK$124 million on machinery and equipment and HK$1,199 million on construction in progress. As at 31st December, 2011, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities. The financial risk management of the Group is the responsibility of the Group’s treasury function at the head office in Hong Kong. One of the major objectives of the Group’s treasury policies is to manage its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Group’s policy not to engage in speculative activities. Most of the Group’s assets and liabilities are denominated in Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi with some denominated in US dollar and Euro. The Group does not expect significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations in this regard. The revenue of city gas distribution operation are derived from recurring gas sales and one-time gas connection fee which respectively accounts for 80% and 20% of the 2011 revenue (2010: 76% and 24% respectively). The turnover of the city gas distribution operation for the year ended 31st December, 2011 amounted to HK$13,507 million, an increase of 62% over that of 2010. The significant increase was mainly due to the increase in gas sales volume by 29% from 5,577 million m3 to 7,215 million m3 and the increase in connection fee income by 40% from HK$1,959 million to HK$2,741 million. The increase in gas sales and connection fee income were in turn driven by the following factors: 50% increase in the daily installed capacity for commercial & industrial (“C&I”) customers from 14.4 million m3 to 21.6 million m3. 20% increase in the number of connected households from 8.77 million to 10.50 million. CAGR=75.2% CAGR=46.9% CAGR=80.5% Non-residential Customers (000s) (Million m3) (000s m3) The city gas distribution operation registered an overall gross profit margin of 29.4% for 2011, which was comparable to 29.7% for 2010. The gross margin of gas sales grew from 20.2% to 21.4% and gross margin of connection fee from 60.5% to 60.9%. Although both the gross margins increased, the overall gross margin remained at about the same level. This is due to the positive change in the revenue mix of gas sales vs connection fee from 76%: 24% in 2010 to 80%: 20% in 2011. The gross profit margin for connection fee income increased from 60.5% for 2010 to 60.9% for 2011 mainly because of connection fee income from cities with relative higher connection fees such as Zhengzhou, Wuxi and Chengdu. The higher overall gas sales margin was mainly contributed from increase in sales from CNG gas stations and sales to industrial customers such as those in the industrial cities of Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Zhenjiang and Jingdezhen. However, this was offset to a certain extent by the lower gas sales margins of sales to residential customers. Gross Margin of Gas Sales Gross Margin of Connection Fee The increase in absolute amounts of selling and distribution and general and administration expenses in 2011 were the result of the 25 projects acquired in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, selling and distribution expenses were 8% for 2011 compared to 6.5% for 2010. The increase was mainly due to the newly acquired projects during the year which will need time to attain higher operating efficiency. Conversely the general and administration expenses reduced from 9.6% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2011 due to the relative fixed nature of these expenses enjoying the economy of scale of operation. The reduction of gross margin of 0.3%, the increase in other revenue of 0.8%, the increase of 0.9% on total selling and distribution and general and administration expenses as well as the increase in contribution from an associate of 0.7% mainly accounts for increase in Earning Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) of 0.2% from 16.3% in 2010 to 16.5% in 2011. Net income after tax of 8.9% was in line with the 8.8% in 2010, despite that there was an increase in taxation (due to increase in effective tax rate as a result of most city gas projects graduating from tax incentive period to non-tax incentive period and the standard tax rate of 25% starts to apply). (HK$ Mm) (HK$ Mm) (HK$ Mm) (HK$ Mm) CAGR=89.9% The city gas distribution operation continued to generate healthy cash flow with an operating cash flow of HK$2,110 million and free cash flow of HK$1,039 million in 2011. The Group recorded a cash balance of HK$6,890 million at the end of 2011, an increase of HK$369 million over the amount at the end of 2010. The Group has continued to leverage on its strong balance sheet to raise low cost finance during 2011 and has a total bank loan of HK$6,500 million outstanding as at 31st December, 2011, with a gross debt to total asset ratio of 26%. The Group maintains a very healthy balance sheet with low gross debt ratio, high EBITDA to interest cover ratio of 35.3 times and net cash balance of HK$390 million at 31st December, 2011. (HK$ Mm) (HK$ Mm) Increase in selling and distribution expenses is mainly due to the inclusion of the projects newly acquired in 2011 which will take some time to achieve scale and efficiency. Note (1): Free Operating Cash Flow(1) (HK$ Mm) (times) (HK$ Mm) In view of the fact that the Group is still in expansion phase, the city gas distribution operation registered reasonable return on equity and return on assets of 14.9% and 7.2% respectively in 2011 (2010: 13.0% and 7.0% respectively). The Group acquired 25 new projects in 2011 including 14 green field projects. The rates of returns are expected to improve once all these newly acquired projects start to attain higher operating efficiency and generate more returns in 2012 and thereafter. Note (1): The higher return on weighted average equity in 2009 was mainly due to the lower shareholders’ equity as a result of the deduction therefrom merger reserves incurred in each of the asset injection from the parent. The impact was less significant after the Company did a share placement in September 2010. 41.1% (1) Previously, the earlier Chengdu, Wuxi and Suzhou projects used to account for more than 80% of the gas sales volume, connection fee and net profit contribution. As the Group has acquired more new projects in 2009, 2010 and 2011, their contribution percentages have decreased and taken up by others such as Chongqing, Zhengzhou, Xiamen, Wuhan, Kunming, Zhenjiang, Zibo, Datong and Jingdezhen. As there will be more acquisitions over the next few years, the percentage contribution from all projects are expected to gradually become more evenly distributed in the future. The broadening of the Group’s earning base will insure the Group from relying heavily on any single city gas project.

The main revenue and gross profit contributors for the year were Yichun Water Industry Co., Ltd (“Yichun Water”) and Yingtan Water Supply Co., Ltd (“Yingtan Water”), which collectively accounted for 68.8% of the consolidated revenue and 79.3% of gross profit respectively. The financial analysis of revenue and gross profit is as follows: Water supply business consisted of 6 water supply plants which were located in Jiangxi Province, Anhui Province, Shandong Province and Hainan Province. The total daily water supply capacities were approximately 1,960,000 tonnes contributing revenue of HK$103.75 million, representing 36.4% of the Group’s total revenue. The price of water supply ranged from HK$1.5 to HK$2.4 per tonne. E_China Water_HAR010().indb 4 Sewage treatment business consisted of 3 sewage treatment plants which were located in Jiangxi Province, Guangdong Province and Shandong Province. The daily disposal sewage capacities were approximately 130,000 tonnes per day contributing revenue of HK$27.37 million, representing 9.6% of the Group’s total revenue. The price of sewage treatment ranged from HK$0.6 to HK$1.6 per tonne. Construction service comprised water meter installation, construction of pipelines and pipelines repairing. This was the Group’s major source of revenue contributing HK$153.83 million during the year, representing 54.0% of the Group’s total revenue. Other operating income decreased by HK$8.85 million to HK$5.80 million (2010: 14.65 million). The income included mainly interest income of HK$1.08 million, the handling fee of HK$1.53 million paid by the PRC government of the respective water plant, cleaning and disinfection handling fees of HK$0.61 million and dismantling fees of HK$0.68 million. Selling and distribution costs together with administrative expenses were collectively increased by HK$13.51 million to HK$83.58 million (2010: HK$70.07 million). The increase was mainly due to additional legal and professional incurred for restructuring of convertible bonds and increase in staff costs. These expenses mainly consisted of legal and professional fees of HK$6.67 million, staff cost of HK$50.10 million, repair and maintenance of HK$2.29 million and depreciation and amortisation of HK$7.61 million. During the period from January to September 2011, the holders of 14,692,390 Convertible Preference Share (“CPS”) and 50,000,000 Convertible Bonds (“CB”) exercised their rights to convert the CPS and CB into fully paid ordinary shares of iMerchants. After the conversion, the equity interest of iMerchants owned by the Company has reduced further from 36.57% as at 31 December 2010 to 12.61% as at 31 December 2011. As a result, the amount of iMerchant’s net asset value shared by the Group decreased from HK$221.97 million to HK$75.67 million. The difference of HK$146.30 million was recognized as a loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Up to 19 September 2011, 3 out of 8 directors of iMerchants who either resigned or retired were also directors of the Company. The Board considered that the Group cannot exercise significant influence over iMerchants’ financial and operating policy decisions. In light of this, the Board determined to reclassify the equity interest in iMerchants to available-for-sale investments. The loss of HK$32.65 million was recognized based upon the comparison of the net asset value of iMerchants shared by the Group with the fair value of the iMerchants’ share price at the date of the of loss significance influence. Impairment loss of HK$79.28 million was mainly provided for the loan receivables advanced to four independent third parties (the “Borrowers”) in the aggregate amount of HK$75.62 million. The directors of the Company have individually assessed these receivables and believe that the Company will have difficulties in recovering the sums indicated. Legal demand letters for collection of the debts were issued to the deposit holder and the respective Borrowers. The possibility of recovery of debts are remote and thin and thus the associated impairment losses are provided. E_China Water_HAR010().indb 5 Included in the available-for-sale investments were equity investment in two listed equity securities in Hong Kong. During the year, no impairment loss has been provided as one of the equity securities which its shares was suspended in trading in the Stock Exchange since 30 June 2011 and up to the report date. In the absence of any available quoted market bid prices, the Company is unable to evaluate the fair value of this equity security and whether it is appropriate to provide any further impairment loss on this investment. In previous year, there was HK$30.50 million of impairment loss provided for this suspended equity security due to significant or prolonged decline in market value. During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group recognized an impairment loss in aggregate amount of HK$145.61 million in relation to the goodwill arising from acquisition of Blue Mountain Hong Kong Group Limited (“Blue Mountain”), Onfar International Limited (“Onfar”), Anhui Dang Shan Water Industry Company Ltd* (“Anhui Dang Shan”) and Foshan City Gaoming Huaxin Sewage Treatment Company Ltd* ( ) (“Gaoming Huaxin”) (2010: HK$40.25 million). The goodwill arose from the acquisition of Blue Mountain, Onfar, Anhui Dang Shan and Gaoming Huaxin which was allocated to the cash-generating units for the provision of water supply and sewage treatment. The impairment loss incurred as the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the individual cash-generating units less than the respective carrying amount of the units. The carrying amount included the carrying value of goodwill and the net asset value. The impairment loss of HK$36.99 million was mainly provided for Danzhou Qingyuan Water Industry Company Limited* ( ) and Onfar, amounting to HK$28.57 and HK$8.42 respectively (2010: Nil). The concession intangible assets are the exclusive operating rights granted by the respective local governments to the water supply plants and sewage treatment plants for the provision of water supply services and sewage treatment services to the public users. The loss was due to the estimated recoverable amounts in using concession intangible assets less than its respective carrying amounts. Owing to the continuing losses during the year ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, the impairment loss of HK$33.54 million was provided for Jinan Hongquan Water Production Co. Ltd. (“Jinan Hongquan”) whose business activity is provision of water supply service (2010: Nil). In light of the continuing loss-making of Anhui Dang Shan, the impairment loss of HK$20.42 million was provided for the property, plant and equipment due to the estimated recoverable amount less than its respective carrying amounts. Finance costs of HK$31.95 million were mainly represented by interest payments to banks and other loans of HK$14.33 million and to the convertible bond (“CB”) holders of HK$17.08 million (2010: HK$9.53 million). The increase of HK$22.41 million was mainly additional interest paid to CB holders of HK$15.91 million. E_China Water_HAR010().indb 6 The Group had two associated companies, iMerchants and Jinan Hongquan. As at 31 December 2011, the Group held 12.61% equity interests in iMerchants and shared the loss of HK$18.97 million.

As at 31 December 2011, the Group recorded cash and bank balance including cash held at financial institutions of HK$91.83 million (compared with HK$138.02 million on 31 December 2010).

The Group has had steady cash flow generating from the water supply and sewage treatment business segments. Total liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2011 were HK$721.55 million (compared with HK$791.59 million on 31 December 2010). They mainly comprised of the CB of HK$212.03 million (2010: HK$400.19 million), bank and other borrowings of HK$194.08 million (2010: HK$142.87 million), and government grants of HK$71.35 million (2010: HK$64.07 million). The CB were denominated in HK dollars, while others were denominated in Renminbi and the interest rates of which were fixed. The Group’s gearing ratio as at 31 December 2011 was 70.38% (2010: 55.76%). The ratio was calculated by dividing total liabilities of HK$721.55 million over total assets of the Group of HK$1,025.22 million. The Group’s consolidated non-current assets decreased by HK$312.78 million to HK$762.94 million (2010: HK$1,075.73) million. The decrease was mainly attributable to the cost of investment of HK$229.50 million in associate, iMerchants. The reduced cost of investment was mainly as a result of the loss on deemed partial disposal and the loss on reclassification from associate to available-for-sales investments. After deduction the aforesaid losses, the balance of cost of investment relating to iMerchants was reclassified as available-for-sales investments upon the loss of significant influence by the Group. The trade and other receivables including loans receivable in the current asset decreased by HK$52.51 million to HK$96.39 million (2010: HK$148.90 million).

Following the repurchase, no Bonds are remained outstanding. The amount paid for the repurchasing of the Bonds was at approximately 21% discount to the accrued amounts owing to the holders if the outstanding Bonds were held to maturity, the Directors took the view that the terms for the repurchase were favorable to the Company. E_China Water_HAR010().indb 7 To refinance the repurchase of Bonds, the Company borrowed two short-term interest bearing loans from two independent third parties, one being a 2-month unsecured loan facility of HK$80 million and the other a 6-month secured loan facility of HK$205 million. Both loans bear interest at rate of 12% per annum.

Ltd (“Subscriber”). The net proceeds of approximately HK$277 million from the issuance of Convertible Notes were utilized for the repayment of the aforesaid two short-term interest bearing loans.

E_China Water_HAR010().indb 10 (ii) On 6 November 2007, the People’s Government of Danzhou and Super Sino entered into an assets and liabilities transfer agreement, pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of Danzhou City Water Company* ( ) were transferred to Super Sino. On 26 June 2008, Agricultural Bank of China Danzhou Branch instituted proceedings with Hainan Intermediate People’s Court against Danzhou City Water Company, Super Sino and the People’s Government of Danzhou (a third party) regarding the abovementioned transfer of the relevant liabilities, claiming for the principal of RMB26 million and the interest thereon of RMB45.56 million repayable by Danzhou City Water Company and Super Sino (as defendants). On 13 November 2009, the First Intermediate People’s Court of Hainan Province issued a civil verdict, pursuant to which Super Sino was ordered to fully repay the loan principal of RMB26 million together with the interest thereon. On 17 December 2009, the Plaintiff made an appeal to the Higher People’s Court of Hainan Province court seeking the fulfilment of the guarantee responsibility of Danzhou Urban Development Corporation. On 15 December 2010, Higher People’s Court of Hainan Province issued verdict, pursuant to which all the shares of Danzhou City Water Company owned by Super Sino (the “shares”) have been frozen from 15 December 2010 to 14 December 2012. The Company cannot transfer or dispose of the shares during the period. According to the legal advice, the directors of the Company are of the opinion that the verdict will not impair the control of the Group over Danzhou City Water Company due to the following reason: Super Sino is still the legal owner of Danzhou City Water Company during the year ended 31 December 2011 and up to the report date. As Danzhou City Water Company is engaged in the business of provision of water in the PRC which requires special license from the respective the PRC government authorities. The procedures for the change of shareholding is complicated and require the approval from several the PRC government authorities. As at the date of this report, the directors of the Company are discussing the settlement arrangement with the Plaintiff and there is no demand for settlement from the Plaintiff at the moment. The principal of the said loan and the interest thereon have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The directors of the Company are of the view that the power to control the financial and operating policies of Danzhou City Water Company are still belonged to the Group. The aforesaid litigation is unlikely to have any significant material financial impact on the Group. Save and except for this, the Company is not aware of any other significant proceedings instituted against the Company. The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal as most of the Group’s subsidiaries operate in the PRC and most of the transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in Renminbi. Accordingly, the Group does not have derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency risks.

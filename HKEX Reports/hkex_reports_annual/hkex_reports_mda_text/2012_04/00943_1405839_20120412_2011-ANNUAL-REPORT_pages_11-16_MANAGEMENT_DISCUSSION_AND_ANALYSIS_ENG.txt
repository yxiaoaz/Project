Turnover of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to HK$137 .1 million, which represented a decrease of 3% as compared to HK$141 .6 million in 2010 . The consolidated loss of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to HK$55 .3 million . This represented an increase of approximately HK$27 .0 million or 95% as compared to the loss of HK$28 .3 million in 2010 . The Group’s manufacturing business continued engage in the manufacture and sales of healthcare and household products for the year ended 31 December 2011 . Turnover of the manufacturing business segment contracted 3% on a year-to-year basis to HK$137 .1 million (2010: HK$141 .6 million) mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and selling price of the products as a result of economic downturn and the European sovereign debt crisis, which created an uncertain consumer sentiment . Cost of sales increased slightly by approximately HK$1 .4 million from HK$116 .5 million to HK$117 .9 million despite the decreased in turnover mainly due to the continue appreciation of RMB and the minimum wages of Dongguan Guangdong Province PRC increased from RMB920 to RMB1,100 in March 2011 . As the decrease in the turnover was more than offset the decrease in its cost of sales, the gross profit margin of the manufacturing business was decreased by 4% from 18% in 2010 to 14% in 2011 and resulted in the decrease of gross profit by HK$6 .0 million from HK$25 .2 million in 2010 to HK$19 .2 million in 2011 . The Company had acquired the entire issued shares capital of Fastport Investments Holdings Limited (“Fastport”) and its 99 .98% indirect interest in the exploration and exploitation rights of a coal mine in the Republic of Indonesia (the “PT Bara Mine”) on 13 July 2011 (the “Very Substantial Acquisition”) . The PT Bara Mine is the project area with approximately 4,093 hectares, located within two administrative sub-districts of Central Kalimantan Province in the Republic of Indonesia, namely Dusun Tengah and Raren Batuah in Kabupaten Barito Timur, which is the subject of and to the operation production IUP (Note 1) license No .545 of 2009 issued to PT Bara by the Regent of East Barito . The license is valid for the period from 28 December 2009 to 23 December 2019 that will permit PT Bara to conduct coal development and production activities at the PT Bara Mine . In accordance with the VALMIN Code (Note 2) and to comply with Note 1: “IUP” Note 2: “VALMIN Code” the Code for the Technical Assessment and Valuation of Mineral and Petroleum Assets and Securities for Independent Expert Reports, adopted by the requirements under Chapter 18 of the Listing Rules, a technical report on the PT Bara Mine, dated 2 June 2011 (the “Technical Report”) prepared by Roma Oil and Mining Associates Limited (“Roma Technical”) was set out in the Company’s circular dated 16 June 2011 (the “Acquisition Circular”) . As stated in the Technical Report, PT Bara Mine has approximately 8 .7 million tonnes of Measured Resources, 11 .5 million tonnes of Indicated Resources and 6 .1 million tonnes of Inferred Resources of coal resources and the quality of which was assessed to be a medium ash sub- bituminous thermal coal (medium energy) . An updated review of the coal resources estimate as at 31 December 2011 was conducted by Roma Technical in February 2012 under the JORC Code (Note 1) which shows no material change for the PT Bara Mine since the last resource estimate done by them in June 2011 . Set out below is the highlight of the review: (in thousand tonnes) As at 2 As at 31 JORC Category June 2011 December 2011 Change in % Measured Indicated Inferred Total The Very Substantial Acquisition has formed the basis of the Group’s mining business segment . However, no turnover was recorded for this business segment for 2011 as the PT Bara Mine was still in its development stage since the completion of the Very Substantial Acquisition in July 2011 . During 2011, approximately HK$17 .3 million acquisition and exploration related expenditures were capitalized as costs of the mining rights . Note:1 “JORC Code” Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, published by the Joint Ore Reserves committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Other income was increased by HK$3 .0 million due to fair value gain of HK$2 .4 million on the call option assets and derivative component of the convertible bonds issued by the Company in July 2011 (the “Convertible Bonds 2011”) and the reversal of certain over-provision for accrued expenses in previous years . Administrative expenses of the Group were increased by HK$11 .9 million mainly due to loss of HK$6 .1 million on early partial redemption of the Convertible Bonds 2011 and increase in expenses related to our Indonesia office and other projects . Finance costs were increased from HK$1 .6 million in 2010 to HK$13 .5 million in 2011 mainly due to the effective interest charges on liability component of the Convertible Bonds 2011 of HK$11 .8 million . Although a gradual return of confidence and recovery of investment and consumption are expected for the European Union countries in the second half of 2012 (Interim economic forecast of the European Commission, February 2012), we believe the global consumer confidence will remain weak in 2012 as trend of economic recovery still needs to be consolidated . In order to ensure that we are capable of maintaining our competiveness if the recovery continues, we will focus on new products development and improvement to existing products . In addition, we will continue our effort to improve workers efficiency . According to the latest HKTDC Research survey dated 12 January 2012, 79% of Hong Kong companies saw rising labour costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the PRC . We expect such trend will continue in 2012 and remains as the biggest challenge to our manufacturing business . According to the development plan as disclosed in the Acquisition Circular, the production of the mine will commence 18 months from completion of the acquisition or in the first quarter of 2013 and therefore the coal mining business will not have any contribution to the Group’s turnover and profit in 2012 . Since the completion of the acquisition, the Company had engaged a local mining consultant to assist the Company in a number of areas, including land compensation negotiation, planning for mine development, production and logistics . Based on the current progress and without any unforeseen circumstances, the Company does not anticipate any major delay in the development of the mine . The Company also does not expect any changes at this stage with respect to the estimated capital expenditure of US$6 .8 million for the 12 months period from August 2011 to July 2012 which it still intends to finance through internal funds . In February 2012, following completion of the acquisition, the Indonesia Government enacted Indonesian Government Regulation No . 24 of 2012 regarding Amendments to Government Regulation No . 23 of 2010 regarding Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities (“GR 24”) . GR 24 provides that 51% of shares in an operating mining company (i .e . PT Bara) must be owned by Indonesian shareholder(s) by the end of the 10th year from commencement of production (it is unclear from GR 24 if this is from commencement of any production or from commencement of commercial production and it is expected this is a matter on which mining companies will seek clarification) . GR 24 provides for this to occur in stages from the 6th to the 10th year of commencement of production and thus will not affect the operation of PT Bara in short term . Once shares have been divested to Indonesian shareholder(s), the proportion of equity held by the Indonesian shareholder(s) may not be diluted by further share issues . GR 24 further provides for an order of priority for the prospective Indonesian shareholder(s) to whom shares should be offered, being (in order): (a) central Indonesian Government; (b) regional, provincial or regency government; (c) central Indonesian Government owned company; (d) regional government owned company; and (e) private company wholly owned by Indonesian shareholder(s) . As GR 24 only came into effect on 21 February 2012, there are currently no specific rules regarding pricing of the offer . It is expected that there will be further regulations to be released regarding this . Notwithstanding that PT Bara is held through an intermediate Indonesian company, we expect that the requirements of GR 24 will apply to PT Bara . We will be considering the best way in which to address the requirements of GR 24 . Although all possible effects of GR 24 on the PT Bara Mine in its medium to long term mode of operation are not known yet, our expansion into the coal mine industry as well as other minerals with the aim to broaden the Group’s income base will still be our long-term strategy for enhancing shareholders’ value .

Despite that the Group sustained recurrent losses; the directors of the Company are in the opinion that the Group will have sufficient cash resources to satisfy its future working capital and other financing requirements . The Group has certain exposure to foreign currency risk as most of its business transactions, assets and liabilities are principally denominated in Hong Kong dollars (“HKD”), United States dollars (“USD”) and Renminbi (“RMB”) . The Group currently does not have a foreign currency hedging policy in respect of foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities . The management will monitor the Group’s foreign currency exposure closely and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise and appropriate instrument be available . The interest rates profile of the Group’s borrowings comprises a mixture of fixed and floating rates .

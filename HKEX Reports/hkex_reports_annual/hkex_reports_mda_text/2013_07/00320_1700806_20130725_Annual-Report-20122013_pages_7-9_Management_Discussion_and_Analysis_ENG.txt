The Group’s turnover for the Year, which amounted to HK$2,526,587,000, increased by approximately 4.0% compared with last year. The consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company was HK$31,111,000 for the Year, compared to HK$33,252,000 for the year ended 31 March 2012. Basic earnings per share for the Year amounted to 3.7 HK cents, compared to 4.0 HK cents in last year. Turnover of the Group amounted to HK$2,526,587,000 for the Year, representing an increase of 4.0% over last year. Despite the volatile global economy with prolonged European debt concerns and a sluggish economic recovery in the US, the Group recorded a 4.0% increase in sales during the Year which was mainly due to the revenue growth in its Appliance Controls business with further expansion into the Mainland China domestic market and restocking by certain European customers and the growth in its branded Building and Home Controls business. Consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company decreased from HK$33,252,000 to HK$31,111,000 for the Year, representing a decrease of 6.4%. Gross profit margin decreased to 10.2% for the Year, compared to 11.1% in last year. The decrease was mainly due to the less favorable sales mix and continued increases in production and overhead costs due to inflation, increases in labour costs in Mainland China and appreciation of the Renminbi (“RMB”), all of which caused downward pressure on gross profit margin. Nevertheless, such negative factors were partially offset by the Group’s continued momentum in achieving material cost reductions and operational efficiency improvements. The Group recorded other income of HK$14,339,000 for the Year, compared with HK$11,127,000 in last year mainly due to the increased interest earned on cash balances. The Group managed to maintain operating expenses amounted at HK$238,136,000 during the Year compared to HK$238,692,000 in last year due to intensive expense controls. Segment margin decreased to 2.9% for the Year, compared to 3.2% in last year. The Group recorded improvement in segment margin of Building and Home Controls business largely due to improvement in the branded business and a decrease in sales of relatively low margin products. The Group managed to maintain its segment margin in the Appliance Controls business, despite rising operating cost in Mainland China mainly due to the Group’s continuous efforts in material cost reduction and productivity improvement. However, these were not sufficient to offset the decrease in the Commercial and Industrial Controls business where decreased sales of relatively high margin products negatively impacted segment results. Despite ongoing uncertainties of the worldwide economy that continue to constrain overall customer demand, management believes results are beginning to demonstrate that we are on the right path. Although the operating environment for manufacturing in Mainland China remains challenging with increases in wages, inflation and appreciation of the RMB, the Group anticipates continued improvement in customer demand from key customers who had scaled back over the past two years. Gradual improvement in the rate of growth in new business such as medical products is also promising. The Group will continue its tight cost controls and improvements in operating efficiency and productivity to bring more to the bottom line as the worldwide recovery moves to full throttle. The Group will also continue its efforts to achieve product mix optimization, as it proceeds with the rollout of higher margin smart energy and wireless innovations to solidify its expansion into attractive new consumer markets to drive its business growth. The Group continued to maintain a sound financial and liquidity position in the Year. At 31 March 2013, the Group maintained a balance of cash and cash equivalents of HK$516,063,000, the majority of which were denominated either in US dollars or Hong Kong dollars and HK$208,504,000 were denominated in RMB. The Group’s current ratio remained strong at 1.99 times. Other payables and accrued liabilities decreased from HK$158,737,000 at 31 March 2012 to HK$134,188,000 at 31 March 2013, mainly due to the decrease in deposits received from customers and continuous cost control. At 31 March 2013, total interest-bearing bank borrowings were HK$304,864,000, comprised primarily of bank loans repayable within one year. The majority of these borrowings were denominated either in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars or Euro zone currencies and the interest rates applied were primarily subject to floating rate terms. At 31 March 2013, total equity attributable to owners of the Company amounted to HK$1,057,800,000. The Group had a net cash balance of HK$211,199,000 at 31 March 2013 representing total cash and cash equivalents less total interest- bearing bank borrowings such that no gearing ratio applies. Compared with net cash balance of HK$401,552,000 at 31 March 2012, the decrease was mainly due to the increase in inventories and trade receivables and was mainly due to the increase in the Appliance Controls business which has a longer cash cycle than the Group’s other business segments. The majority of the Group’s sales and purchases are denominated in US dollars and Hong Kong dollars with Euro zone currencies comprising a lesser extent. Due to the fact that the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, the Group’s exposure to this foreign exchange risk is relatively low. Certain production and operating overheads of the Group’s production facilities in Mainland China are denominated in RMB. At 31 March 2013, the Group did not have any outstanding financial instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Nevertheless, the Group will closely monitor its overall foreign exchange exposure and interest rate exposure and will adopt a proactive but prudent approach to minimize the relevant exposures when necessary. During the Year, the Group incurred total capital expenditure of approximately HK$77,400,000 for additions to property, plant and equipment as well as for deferred expenditure associated with the development of new products. At 31 March 2013, the Group had contracted but not provided for capital commitments, mainly for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of HK$1,700,000. At 31 March 2013, no bank deposit and other assets had been pledged to secure the Group’s banking facilities. A subsidiary of the Company is involved in a dispute with a third party, who is alleging that the subsidiary has infringed patent and is seeking for value in dispute of EUR937,500 (equivalent to approximately HK$9,309,000). On 20 March 2013, the relevant district court granted a favorable decision to the subsidiary. At 31 March 2013, the Group had a total of approximately 3,800 full-time employees. Total staff costs for the Year amounted to HK$266,848,000. Salaries and wages are generally reviewed on an annual basis in accordance with individual qualifications and performance, the Group’s results and market conditions. The Group provides year-end double pay, discretionary bonus, medical insurance, provident fund, educational subsidy and training to its employees. The Company has also adopted a share option scheme under which the Company can grant options to, inter alia, employees of the Group to subscribe for shares of the Company with a view to rewarding those who have contributed to the Group and encouraging employees to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its shares for the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Up to the date of this annual report, 21,206,000 share options remained outstanding under such share option scheme. The proceeds from the Company’s issue of new shares (including shares issued on the exercise of over-allotment option) for listing on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) in October 2006, after deduction of related expenses, amounted to approximately HK$469,419,000. The Group intends to apply the net proceeds for the purposes as set out in the section headed “Future Plans and Use of Proceeds” in the prospectus of the Company dated 25 September 2006. As at 31 March 2013, approximately HK$114,000,000 were utilized for strategic business combination and acquisitions, approximately HK$20,950,000 for the expansion of product offerings and distribution networks, approximately HK$44,176,000 for the repayment of bank borrowings and approximately HK$44,176,000 for general corporate purposes, and the remaining balance of the net proceeds was placed in certain financial institutions and licensed banks in Hong Kong as short-term deposits.

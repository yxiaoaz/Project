At present, the world’s economy is still under severe situation. The economy of the PRC is the first to get rid of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the foreign COVID-19 pandemic on shipping logistics and trade is still uncertain. International grain trade has attracted much attention, and the international food prices have continued to rise. The PRC is the world’s largest food importer. Soybean imports have exceeded 100 million tonnes, and maize and other grain imports have set historical records. During the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, the PRC proposed to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern in which domestic and international cycles are the mainstay and the domestic and international dual cycles promote are complementary to each other. Grain, as an important material for people’s livelihood in the country, is an important part of the overall work of serving the country’s “stability on the six fronts” and “security in the six areas”. Therefore, ensuring food security is of vital strategic significance. Under the new development pattern of dual cycle, the scale of national breeding continues to expand, the demand for maize, sorghum and other feed materials as well as soybean protein will be strong, the domestic supply gap will be gradually enlarged, and grain imports will become the mainstream. Rizhao Port Jurong Co., Ltd. From the analysis of international trade, due to the limitation of domestic arable land and planting costs of the PRC, soybeans will still be dependent on imports in the future, and a moderate import policy for soybeans is an important part for ensuring national food security. From the perspective of the domestic market, with the rapid growth of domestic meat consumption, our country’s import demand for soybeans, maize, sorghum and other feed grains and vegetable oils will continue to grow in the future. We expect that imports of agricultural products will bring opportunities to the business development of the Company. With the economic and social development of the PRC and the improvement of the level of production and consumption of residents in the PRC, the consumption of feed and industrial conversion grain continues to increase, the total grain consumption increases rigidly, and the grain consumption structure continues to upgrade. In the future, imports of maize, wheat, sorghum and other grains will be diversified. To this end, the Company will focus on the following tasks: The production capacity improvement plan of hinterland enterprises, the empowerment of the policy of integration of port, industry and city, and the development strategy of river-sea linkage have opened up new growth space for the Company’s continuous increase of grain varieties.

Leveraging on the leading edge of grain business, the Company will expand the room for development of grain business. Through enhancing the efficiency of resources, the Company aims to realize specialized operation and integrated development, and expand the scale of grain business in Rizhao Port. The Group has innovated the production organization model, made plans for berthing and storage, improved the comprehensive utilization rate of berths, analyzed the pattern of silo and yard storage, implemented yard quota management, developed storage capacity outside the port, increased cargo turnover, improved equipment support capabilities, gave full play to the environmental protection and high efficiency advantages of process equipment to realize smart green production.

Annual Report 2010 5 The year witnessed the commencement of our new 7-year licence to provide front-end GETS services (“GETS II”) and our new contract to provide Call Centre Services under the Road Cargo System (“ROCARS”). Both were launched successfully at the beginning of 2010 without any problem. The year also witnessed a recovery of our revenue from below the HK$200 million mark in 2009 to HK$216 million. Although this represents only an 8.5% improvement over 2009, the entire increase went straight to our bottom line since we were able to hold our costs largely at 2009 levels. As a result, the 8.5% increase in turnover together with the other income recorded during the year at HK$12.4 million translated to a 46.1% increase in our profit from operations, up from HK$58.6 million to HK$85.6 million. Particularly pleasing is the significant improvement in our margins from 29.4% to 39.6%. 2010 was thus a threshold year for us, arresting the trend of falling revenue, diminishing margins and declining profits since our listing in 2005. We are committed to continuing this reversal in the coming year. Tradelink’s core business of providing front-end GETS services recorded an increase of 6% in 2010 compared with 2009 while the whole market grew by 10%. As mentioned in our 2010 Interim Report, the reduction in our market share for this year was anticipated as it was due mainly to the introduction of a third service provider in January 2010. With the third service provider, competition in the GETS market will inevitably intensify, putting pressure on our future revenue and margins. For this reason, we will need to further address our costs and devise plans to re-orientate our business to meet the challenge. During 2010, we successfully tendered for the Hongkong Post’s services to collect paper trade declarations from users without the facilities to submit the documents electronically to the Government (Hongkong Post previously provided the service to one of our competitors). The Hongkong Post service on our behalf, commenced in November 2010 at 17 designated post offices, will extend Tradelink’s reach significantly and enhance our service to traders. 6 Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited Tradelink/DTTN (continued) Regarding our commercial services, leveraging on Tradelink applications and DTTN functionalities, we continued to make steady progress during the year in promoting our total solutions to the logistics and manufacturing industry, both in Hong Kong and in China. New customers were enabled to use our solutions to automate their shipping/logistics processes to transact electronically with the Government and their trading partners, achieving efficiencies and cost savings. We also assisted a number of our existing customers to further enhance our solutions for them to support new business processes and/or new partners, allowing them to achieve greater benefits. Regarding our overall Tradelink/DTTN integration initiative, underway since our acquisition of DTTNCo in March 2009, the first phase, involving the integration of the operations of the two companies, was completed in mid- 2009. The second phase, involving the technical integration of the two computer platforms, which commenced in late 2009, continued into 2010. By mid-2010, we completed the consolidation of common peripherals and ancillary facilities while the proof-of-concept for the integration of all applications on the two computer platforms was successfully completed by year-end. This will pave the way for completion of integration work during 2011. Once completed, we will be able to reap the full benefits of our acquisition of DTTNCo, achieve cost savings and further improve our service offerings. During 2010, Digi-Sign also made very encouraging progress. As part of its traditional digital certification business, it entered into an agreement with a service provider operating one of the biggest Automatic Teller Machines (“ATM”) network in Hong Kong and Macau to provide digital certification services to facilitate the adoption and deployment of the next generation chip-based ATM cards in both Special Administrative Regions. The project opens up potential business opportunities for Digi- Sign to offer its digital certification services for ATM cards issued by banks using that ATM network. In addition, it continued its expansion into the e-banking security market by successfully assisting several major banks in Hong Kong to upgrade their e-banking authentication systems to fully comply with the security guidelines of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Leveraging on this experience, Digi-Sign is in the final stages of discussions with a major bank in Hong Kong regarding the provision of security token services to meet their e-banking needs. Plans to extend the service to a consortium of other banks, under a proposed common authentication scheme, are also in train. These too could open up additional business opportunities for Digi-Sign. Annual Report 2010 7 As regards our activities in the China market, we continued to pursue the strategy began in 2008/9 of expanding our activities there through engaging strategic partners. Our two joint ventures in Beijing, i.e. the logistics park at Pinggu and the Data Centre operated by China International Data Systems Co., Ltd. (previously known as Beijing Changdian Zhiyuan Optoelectronic Co., Ltd.), both commenced operations during the latter stages of 2010. Although both operated at a loss for the year as they are still in their start- up phases, we expect them to turn profitable in 2011. At the same time, business at our third joint venture in Guangzhou saw a marked recovery during the year, turning in a profit of RMB6.3 million for 2010, a 99% increase year on year. Apart from these investments, we are exploring a number of other partnership arrangements in China, all aimed at improving our ability to penetrate the market more efficiently and effectively. As these either involve agreements to cross-sell each other’s products/services or to market jointly developed systems/services, these discussions have been concentrated with partners with core competencies that are complementary to ours and who have a high degree of synergy with our business activities. If successful, these will improve our ability to market our services in China. The Group’s overall turnover for the year was HK$216.1 million, increased by 8.5% as a result of the growth of the GETS market.

No other income was recorded in 2009. Depreciation charges for 2010 amounted to HK$20.9 million, HK$2.2 million higher than in 2009. The increase was due to the full year impact of the consolidation of depreciation charges for DTTNCo in 2010 and the capital expenditure on the upgrade of our GETS computer platform in compliance with the GETS II Contract requirements. Profit from operations for 2010 was HK$85.6 million, an increase of 46.1% as compared to HK$58.6 million in 2009. For the year, the net amount of losses shared from associates was HK$4.0 million.

Since implementation of the share award scheme in 2009, no additional options have been granted to employees although options previously granted remain valid.

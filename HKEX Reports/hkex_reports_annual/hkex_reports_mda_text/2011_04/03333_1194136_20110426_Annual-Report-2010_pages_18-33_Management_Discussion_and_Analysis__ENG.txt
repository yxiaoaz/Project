Gross profit of the Group amounted to RMB13.37 billion, or an increase of 585.6% compared with last year, which was mainly due to a remarkable increase in the area of properties delivered during the year. Gross profit margin was 29.2% or a decrease of 4.8 percentage points over last year, which was mainly due to the concentration in the delivery of mid-end and mid- to high-end properties nationwide during the year, while the revenue of last year was more attributable to the properties in Guangdong Province which were sold at relatively higher selling prices and gross profit margin. Selling and marketing costs of the Group rose to RMB1.57 billion in 2010 from RMB1.08 billion in 2009, which was mainly due to an increase in the number of projects launched during the year, the expansion in scale and the corresponding increase in national marketing and brand publicity activities. However the proportion of selling and marketing costs to total revenue for the year was 3.4%, a decrease of 15.4 percentage points from 18.8% in 2009, which indicated our improvement in controlling the selling and marketing costs. Administrative expenses of the Group increased by RMB0.64 billion to RMB1.38 billion from RMB0.74 billion in 2009, which was mainly due to our continued expansion in the business throughout China, the relatively substantial increase in operating results for the year and corresponding increases in the number of employees and their remuneration level. The proportion of administrative expenses to total revenue for the year was 3.0%, a decrease of 10.0 percentage points from 13.0% in 2009, which indicated our improvement in mitigating administrative expenses. The Group newly acquired 67 land plots in 49 cities in China and the GFA of these land reserve was 51.126 million square meters; 50.9% of the total GFA of land reserve newly acquired during the year was located in third-tier cities and there was a total of 34 new projects in third-tier cities, the average cost of such land reserve was RMB492 per square meter; As at the end of the year, the total GFA of land reserve of the Group reached 96.003 million square meters and the average cost was RMB520 per square meter. “Forward-looking layout and winning on strategy” is the overall concept of the Group in obtaining high quality and low cost land reserve. In light of the tough competition in top-tier markets and the increasingly evident impact of the adjustments and control policies on the real estate market, on the basis of the strategy for “nationwide layout and the advance into second-tier markets” since 2004, the Group proposed the long-term strategy of “intensive cultivation of second-tier markets alongside the development of third-tier markets” for the first time during the year, with focus on the vast number of third-tier cities in China. The Group believes that user demand will be immense, considering China’s vast area and population and the varying degrees of regional market development and stages of development. Developing third-tier cities will help us to open up markets and construct extensive and indepth business systems, hence stabilizing fluctuations and eliminating industry risks. At the same time, it will help us to tap real user demand and develop more diversified residential properties, which will coincide with the original intent of the central government for macro adjustments to increase market supply and support user demand. At present, China has 287 cities at prefecture level or above and an urban population of approximately 380 million people which accounts for 28.6% of the national population, of which the majority are third-tier cities that are neither municipalities nor provincial capitals. Seven years ago, the Group carried out nationwide development and advanced into second-tier cities, which solidified our leading position in the standardized operation and quality properties in China. By the end of 2010, the Group penetrated 62 cities in China, of which 39 were third-tier cities and the total GFA of the land reserve was 96.003 million square meters. The Group believes that a long-term strategy leveraging the development of third-tier cities has enabled us to grab hold of the historic opportunities arising from the process of urbanization in China and will guide us to march into a more far-reaching future.

As at the end of the year, the Group had 69 projects under construction, of which 59 projects received pre-sale permits; the GFA under construction was approximately 23.97 million square meters, of which the saleable area under construction was 23.748 million square meters and the saleable area under construction pending for contracted sales was approximately 45.08 million square meters. The vast scale of development and construction and the area of properties available for delivery have fully paved the way for contracted sales and the revenue recognized upon delivery of properties in the next stage. During the year, the Group appropriately increased its investment properties profile such as stores and car parks in order to obtain long term and stable growth of cash flow to supplement the property operation. As at the end of 2010, the Group possessed approximately 347,141 square meters of stores and commercial centers etc. and 34,242 units of car parks. During the year, the rental situations of the properties were satisfactory. We achieved a total rental income of RMB51.17 million, or a year- on-year increase of 36.1%; segmental profit was RMB3.41 billion, of which fair value gain of the investment properties amounted to RMB3.35 billion (net of deferred tax was approximately RMB2.51 billion). Chongqing Distribution of Completed Areas for 2010 Percentage of Guangdong Liaoning Inner Mongolia Autonomous Total Overall Situation of Delivery of Properties for 2010 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) The property management and other property related business met the needs of property development and became an integral part of the value chain of the Group, hence enhancing our core competitiveness and improving our brand reputation. Jinbi Property Management Co., Ltd. under the Group was incorporated in 1997 and possessed first class property management qualifications in China. It was one of the first which obtained the ISO9001:2000 quality management system certification. For the 12 years since its establishment, Jinbi Property Management has always provided dedicated property services to thousands of property owners through its security guard team with its own features, special property services and special community culture. During the year, the Group recorded revenue from property management of RMB132.22 million, representing a year-on- year growth of 66%. It was mainly because the GFA of completed and delivered properties for the year was higher and thus additional property management fee was charged. The Group will strive to build a service system integrating real estate and property, maintain its leading position in fundamental services and improve the operating conditions of the property system. Supported by a complete set of facilities of the projects, we will endeavour to provide integrated value-added services in relation to leisure, film and television, sports and health according to actual customer needs to further increase customer loyalty. During the year, the Group recorded a total of RMB278.02 million of revenue generated from other property related business including hotel services, construction services, football and volleyball clubs operations, or a year-on-year decrease of RMB284.66 million. As of 31 December 2010, the borrowings of the Group amounted to RMB31.16 billion with the following drawdown periods: As a percentage of As a percentage of Annual Report 2010 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) As at 31 December 2010, the total amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash was RMB19.95 billion, and together with the unutilized banking facilities of RMB33.25 billion, the Group has sufficient working capital. The successful issuance of RMB9.25 billion senior notes on 13 January 2011 further provided adequate funds and strengthened the financial capability of the Group, and provided great financial support for our quest for the best business opportunities and speedy support. As of 31 December 2010, the net current assets of the Group increased by 101.7% to RMB34.17 billion compared to 2009. The total borrowings to total assets ratio and net debt ratio (net borrowings to total equity) are 29.8% and 52.5% respectively. The total borrowings to EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.5 times in 2010 from 18.6 times in 2009 and the interest coverage ratio increased from 0.6 times in 2009 to 6.0 times in 2010. Amidst a rapid growth in business, the Group still possessed a sound financial structure and was capable to respond to various kinds of potential risks. As at 31 December 2010, the Group arranged bank financing for several property buyers and provided a buy-back guarantee in relation to the repayment obligations of approximately RMB25.45 billion for those buyers. The Group had not suffered from significant loss resulting from the above guarantee in the past, which was mainly because the guarantee concerned was only a transitional arrangement for property buyers prior to the completion of mortgage registration and was pledged against property rights, in addition to the fact that it will be removed once the mortgage registration is completed. Considering the above factors, the Board is of the view that buyers’ arrears are unlikely and thus no provision will be required for this. As at 31 December 2010, RMB22,409.9 million borrowings are denominated by RMB and carry floating rate interests, the remaining RMB8,750.3 million borrowings are denominated by US dollar and carry fixed rate interests. We have always been emphasising on a stable loan structure. As at 31 December 2010, only approximately 22.5% of the loans had to be repaid within one year. Our total amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash was RMB19.95 billion. With our successful issuance of RMB9.25 billion senior notes on 13 January 2011, in which 45% of the proceed is used to repay the onshore borrowings, the structure of our borrowings was further optimised. The above borrowings were pledged against the property and equipment, investment properties, properties under development, completed properties held for sale, cash at bank of the Group and the shares of certain subsidiaries of the Group at an effective average interest rate of 8.26% for the year (2009: 9.58%). The Group’s businesses are principally conducted in Renminbi. Other than the foreign currency denominated bank deposits and the senior notes denominated in US dollar, the Group does not have any material exposure directly due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The Group has not entered into any significant forward exchange contract to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk.

Management Discussion 2010 was the most complicated year for the global economy since the global financial crisis of 2008. During 2010, the major global economies gradually stepped into recovery mode; the Chinese economy maintained its sound growth trend and the transformation of Chinese economic development continued as well. In 2010, China’s GDP increased by 10.3%, and its foreign trade value increased by 34.7% as compared with 2009. Benefiting from the fast recovery of the macro economy, the cargo volume increased rapidly. Since the 2009 volume was relatively low and the throughput of China’s ports continued to grow after the recovery in 2009, cargo volume achieved double digit growth; performance of ports in China was better than expected and operating results improved accordingly. Total cargo throughput at the major ports of China achieved 8.02 billion tonnes in 2010, an increase of 15.9% over 2009, versus an increase of 8.2% last year. Included in that total, the coastal ports’ cargo volume amounted to 5.45 billion tonnes, an increase of 15.2% over 2009, and inland river ports’ cargo volume amounted to 2.57 billion tonnes, an increase of 17.8% over the same period last year. During the same period, the container throughput amounted to 145 million TEUs, an increase of 18.8% over 2009. In 2010, both the container volume and growth rate achieved better results than prior to the global financial crisis. The coastal ports handled a total of 130.65 million TEUs, an increase of 18.7% over 2009, and the inland river ports handled a total of 14.35 million TEUs, an increase of 19.5% over 2009. The Group’s principal business is categorized into eight segments, namely: provision of oil/liquefied chemicals terminal and related logistics services (“Oil Segment”), provision of container terminal and related logistics services (“Container Segment”), provision of automobile terminal and related logistics services (“Automobile Terminal Segment”), provision of ore terminal and related logistics services (“Ore Segment”), provision of general cargo terminal and related logistics services (“General Cargo Segment”), provision of bulk grain terminal and related logistics services (“Bulk Grain Segment”), provision of passenger and roll-on, roll-off terminal and related logistics services (“Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment”), and provision of port value-added services and ancillary port operations (“Value-added Services Segment”). In 2010, the macro economy and industries relevant to the Group’s principal business were as follows: Oil Segment: Domestic demand for crude oil steadily increased. In 2010, China imported a total of 238 million tonnes of crude oil, an increase of 16.7% over 2009, which was higher than the growth rate of 13.9% in 2009. Container Segment: Driven by economic recovery, the foreign trade value in the Three Northeastern Provinces increased by 37.4% in 2010, being 2.7% higher than China’s average growth rate. The foreign trade value in the Three Northeastern Provinces accounted for 4.4% of China’s foreign trade, which was 0.1% higher than 2009. Such growth in the Group’s hinterland provided strong support for the growth of the Group’s container business. Automobile Terminal Segment: According to the data of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China manufactured 18,264,700 vehicles and sold 18,061,900 vehicles in 2010, each an increase of 32.4% over the last year, resulting from growth in domestic purchases of automobiles and recovery of automobile exports from China. The sales achieved by large-sized automobile manufacturers increased and the operational results of the automobile industry also improved strongly. Ore Segment: Since the pricing system of iron ore changed to index pricing in 2010, the price for imported iron ore has continued to increase. China imported 618.63 million tonnes of iron ore in 2010, a decrease of 1.4% over 2009. This was the first decrease in China’s annual imports of iron ore over the past 12 years. General Cargo Segment: China produced 630 million tonnes of crude steel in 2010, an increase of 9.3% over 2009, being 4.2% lower than 2009. Impacted by the macro economic policies, domestic demand for steel declined following an increase that occurred earlier in 2010. Due to the rapid recovery of China’s economy, overall demand for electricity and other energy increased significantly. As a result, demand for coal in China continued to maintain an increased growth rate in 2010. Bulk Grain Segment: Market demand for grains in China continued to grow during recovery in 2010. In terms of trans-shipment of grain for domestic trade, the volume of the grains transported from the north to the south of China continued to grow; however, the growth slowed down following the rapid growth that occurred earlier in 2010. Due to the imbalance of grain varieties in China, local demand for imported soy bean and barley resulted in steady growth in imported grain volume, and this growth is expected to continue in the long-term. Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment: Due to the recovery of the economy, trade in goods and materials between northeastern China and north China became more frequent, especially trade in small and medium-sized enterprises, and this accelerated the growth of our roll-on roll-off terminal business along the Bohai Rim. The above data indicate that the overall macro economy of the Group’s hinterland achieved sound growth in 2010 and foreign trade in its hinterland recovered significantly. The Group’s principal businesses achieved steady growth, among which the throughput in the Automobile Terminal Segment recorded significant growth, the throughput in the Container Segment made a recovery, and the throughput in the General Cargo Segment, Oil Segment and Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment recorded growth as well. In the Oil Segment, the Group handled a total of approximately 43.549 million tonnes, an increase of 9.4% over 2009, of which approximately 25.499 million tonnes was imported crude oil, an increase of 13.3% over 2009. In the Container Segment, the Group handled approximately 6.337 million TEUs, an increase of 15.5% over 2009, of which approximately 5.242 million TEUs were handled by the Group at Dalian port, an increase of 18.7% over 2009. In the Automobile Terminal Segment, the Group handled 121,011 vehicles, an increase of 141% over 2009. In the Ore Segment, the Group handled approximately 28.239 million tonnes, an increase of 1.8% over 2009. In the General Cargo Segment, the Group handled approximately 27.54 million tonnes of cargo, an increase of 19.5% over 2009. In the Bulk Grain Segment, the Group handled approximately 6.42 million tonnes of bulk grain, a decrease of 9.5% over 2009. In the Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment, the Group transported approximately 3.037 million passengers, a decrease of 13.8% from the 2009 total and approximately 512,000 vehicles, an increase of 11.5% over 2009. In 2010, The Company’s profit attributable to shareholders amounted to RMB834,233,000, representing an increase of 10.7% as compared with RMB753,329,000 in 2009. This increase was mainly driven by growth in operating profit, gains in disposal of assets and improved performance of the Company’s associates and jointly controlled entities in the current period. The business performance of the Group described in this report, such as throughput data, is an aggregate of all operating entities in which the Group had an equity interest, irrespective of the percentage of equity interest held by the members of the Group. Part of the Group’s current businesses, including the Ore Segment, the General Cargo Segment, the Bulk Grain Segment and the Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment, were acquired in November 2010 from the Company’s controlling shareholder, Dalian Port Corporation Limited, by issuing A Shares as the consideration during the Company’s initial public offering of A Shares in China. The transaction was completed on 30 November 2010. However, the performance of such businesses in 2010 reported here represents the full year data of 2010. In 2010, the Company’s profit attributable to shareholders amounted to RMB834,233,000, representing an increase of 10.7% as compared with RMB753,329,000 in 2009. This increase was mainly driven by the growth in operating profit, gains on disposal of assets and improved performance of the Company’s associates and jointly controlled entities in the current period. In 2010, the Company’s basic earnings per share were RMB22.38 cents, representing an increase of 8.85% from RMB20.56 cents in 2009. The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. If the calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on 4,426 million issued shares at the end of 2010, the Company’s basic earnings per share were RMB18.85 cents, representing an increase of 10.7% over 2009. In 2010, the Company’s revenue amounted to RMB3,316,675,000, representing an increase of 9.9% from RMB3,017,653,000 in 2009. The revenue increase was mainly driven by the growth of the tugging business and electricity sales caused by the economic recovery and our market development efforts, and increased income from our Bulk Grain and General Cargo Segments caused by throughput growth and increases in handling charges. In 2010, the Company’s cost of sales and services amounted to RMB1,994,154,000, an increase of 5.3% as compared with RMB1,893,416,000 in 2009. The increase in cost of sales and services in the current year was mainly due to an increase in depreciation of new assets, as well as increases in fuel, utilities and staff costs caused by the growth of our business. I n 2 0 1 0 , t h e C o m p a n y ’ s g r o s s p r o f i t w a s RMB1,322,521,000, an increase of 17.6% from RMB1,124,237,000 in 2009. The gross margin reached 39.9% which was 2.6% higher than that in 2009. The improvement was mainly due to increases in the gross margin of our Bulk Grain and General Cargo Segments, and the high-margin business of sales of land use rights, and a decrease in our low-margin oil sales business. I n 2 0 1 0 , t h e C o m p a n y ’ s o t h e r i n c o m e w a s RMB117,156,000, and in 2009 it was RMB66,973,000. The increase was mainly due to an increase in income from disposal of assets. In 2010, the Company’s finance costs amounted to RMB85,292,000, representing an increase of 14.9% from RMB74,221,000 in 2009. The increase was mainly due to an increase in finance costs caused by new bank loans. In 2010, the Company’s income tax expense amounted to RMB236,580,000, an increase of 87.2% from RMB126,388,000 in 2009. The increase was mainly due to increased operating profit. In addition, the increase in income tax in 2010 was due to the deduction of a net loss on relocation of oil terminal assets before tax, and an income tax refund of the Container Segment in 2009. As of 31 December 2010, the Company’s total assets and net assets reached RMB22,387,703,000 and RMB12,066,980,000, respectively, and its net asset value per share was RMB2.69, representing an increase of 7.1% from 31 December 2009. The increase was mainly caused by the successful issue of A Shares and growth of our business. As of 31 December 2010, the Company’s total liabilities amounted to RMB10,320,723,000, of which total outstanding bank and other borrowings accounted for RMB6,144,634,000. In 2010, the Company’s net cash flows generated from operating and financing activities amounted to RMB1,441,852,000 and RMB2,999,767,000, respectively. With stable cash inflows from its operating activities and the proceeds from the public offering of A Shares, the Company has maintained a sound financial position and capital structure and will apply these cash inflows to fund the Company’s capital expenditure and other investments. As of 31 December 2010, the Company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of RMB3,257,585,000, which represented an increase of RMB1,997,315,000 as compared with 31 December 2009. Such increase was mainly due to the surplus of cash inflows from operating and financing activities. In 2010, the Company obtained an aggregate of RMB1,691,888,000 in new bank loans and repaid an aggregate of RMB939,600,000 in bank loans. As of 31 December 2010, the Company’s bank and other borrowings amounted to RMB6,144,634,000 of which RMB4,874,634,000 was due after one year and RMB1,270,000,000 was due within one year. The Company’s net gearing ratio was 23.9% as at 31 December 2010 (39.8% as at 31 December 2009). As of 31 December 2010, the Company’s unutilised banking facilities amounted to RMB6,880,000,000. As of 31 December 2010, the Company had net current liabilities of RMB368,317,000, representing a decrease of RMB1,399,148,000 as compared with the balance of net current assets as at 31 December 2009. The Company’s current ratio was 0.9 as at 31 December 2010 (1.9 as at 31 December 2009). During 2010, the Company was not considered to have significant exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and did not enter into any foreign exchange hedging contracts. Use of proceeds (A Shares) Net proceeds of the public offering of 762 million A Shares in 2010 (“IPO of A Shares”) obtained by the Company amounted to approximately RMB2,772,092,000. As at 31 December 2010, the Company had utilized approximately RMB1,193,150,000 of the net proceeds and the balance of the net proceeds was RMB1,578,942,000. There has been no material change in the proposed use of proceeds from the IPO of A Shares as stated in the Company’s prospectus dated 3 December 2010 except for changes announced by the Company on 30 December 2010. As at 31 December 2010, the details of the use of proceeds were as follows: Construction of oil storage tanks with a total capacity of Construction of oil storage tanks with a total capacity of Construction of phase II of the Shatuozi oil storage Increase in the registered capital of Dalian International Container Terminal Co., Ltd. Use of proceeds (H Shares) Net proceeds of the public offering of 966 million H Shares obtained by the Company in 2006 amounted to approximately RMB2,385,343,000. As at 31 December 2009, the Company had utilized approximately RMB2,324,853,000 of the net proceeds and the balance of the net proceeds was RMB60,490,000. There has been no material change in the proposed use of proceeds from the IPO of H Shares as stated in the Company’s prospectus dated 18 April 2006. As at 31 December 2010, the details of the use of proceeds were as follows: RMB13,000,000 previously designated to fund the purchase of 8 tugboats was re-allocated as working capital and the remaining RMB60,490,000 designated for the construction of 12 crude oil storage tanks will be used for future construction projects. In 2010, the Company’s capital expenditure amounted to RMB1,946,174,000 which was mainly funded by the surplus cash generated from operating activities, the proceeds from the issuance of medium-term notes and the proceeds from the initial public offering of A Shares. The performance analysis of each business segment in 2010 is as follows. The following table sets out the oil/liquefied chemicals throughput handled by the Group in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: year ended 31 December Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) – Foreign trade (0.5%) In 2010, in terms of oil/liquefied chemicals throughput, the Group handled a total of approximately 43.549 million tonnes, an increase of 9.4% from 2009. In 2010, the Group’s crude oil throughput increased by 6.6% over 2009, to approximately 30.166 million tonnes, of which imported crude oil throughput increased by 13.3%, to approximately 25.499 million tonnes. The Group’s crude oil business achieved sound growth due to the increase in production volume of refineries in the Group’s hinterland which stimulated an increase in imported crude oil, as a result, the crude oil volume handled at the Group’s oil terminal increased. On the other hand, the Group had rationalized overall arrangement of the storage tanks by implementing various measures, such as re-renting storage tanks and relocating partially loaded vessels from berths with larger berthing capacity to berths with smaller berthing capacity to increase crude oil trans- shipment traffic and cargo volume. In 2010, the Group’s refined oil throughput amounted to approximately 12.227 million tonnes, an increase of 17.6% over 2009. The steady recovery of China’s economy drove consumption growth in refined oil. At the same time, the Group actively co-ordinated with relevant parties, such as oil trading companies, railway companies and shipping companies so as to increase trans-shipment traffic of refined oil at the Group’s oil terminal. On the other hand, our newly constructed refined oil commercial storage tanks have the effect of adjusting supply and demand and balancing the market, which assists in the transportation of large vessels by containing transportation costs, and this contributed to the increase in the refined oil throughput of the Group. In 2010, the Group’s liquefied chemicals throughput amounted to approximately 938,000 tonnes, an increase of 5.7% over the 2009 total. In 2010, the total imported crude oil volume handled by the Group accounted for 100% (99.8% in 2009) of the total amount of crude oil imported into Dalian and 75.5% (89% in 2009) of the total amount of crude oil imported into the Three Northeastern Provinces. The total oil/ liquefied chemicals throughput amounted to 69.7% (69.2% in 2009) of the total oil/liquefied chemicals throughput of Dalian and 46.4% (51.2% in 2009) of the total oil/ liquefied chemicals throughput of the Three Northeastern Provinces. The decrease in our market share of imported crude oil throughput in the Three Northeastern Provinces was mainly due to improvement in the crude oil handling and storage facilities and services in other ports in Liaoning province and commencement of operation of some refineries around those ports. In 2010, the revenue from oil/liquefied chemicals terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB886,584,000, representing a decrease of RMB7,493,000 or 0.8% as compared with the total revenue in 2009. Such decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the oil trading business. Despite such decrease, the revenue from handling services increased RMB37,600,000 or 6.6% as compared with the total revenue in 2009. Such increase was mainly driven by the growth of oil throughput. In 2010, the revenue from oil/liquefied chemicals terminal and logistics services accounted for 26.7% (29.6% in 2009) of the Company’s total revenue. In 2010, the gross profit from oil/liquefied chemicals t e r m i n a l a n d l o g i s t i c s s e r v i c e s a m o u n t e d t o RMB499,586,000, representing an increase of 5.4% as compared with RMB474,214,000 in 2009. This profit accounted for 37.8% (42.2% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and represented a gross margin of 56.3% (53.0% in 2009). Such increase in gross margin was mainly caused by the decrease in the low-margin oil trading business. In 2010, the major initiatives taken, and the progress of major projects in relation to the Group’s Oil Segment were as follows: The Group utilized the storage tanks resources in a more balanced way and actively solicited trans- shipment cargos. The Group rationalized the overall arrangement of its storage tank resources by implementing various measures, such as re- renting storage tanks and relocating partially loaded vessels from berths with larger berthing capacity to berths with smaller berthing capacity to increase crude oil trans-shipment traffic and volume. The Group took advantage of the commercial storage tanks to increase its trans-shipment volume of refined oil. PetroChina Company Limited’s refined oil storage tanks (with a total capacity of 240,000 cubic meters) were put into operation at the beginning of 2010. Since then, refined oil storage capacity was increased significantly, which reduced waiting time caused by the shortage of storage tanks. At the same time, the Group took full advantage of the capacity of commercial storage tanks and enhanced communication with its customers, explored services to vessels which called on the Group’s terminal for partial cargo unloading and storage services for refined oil transported via pipelines. The Group’s trans- shipment business was expanded and the services were improved. The commencement of operation of the Group’s No. 7 storage tanks added more storage capacity for trans-shipment business. The No. 7 storage tanks (with a total capacity of 600,000 cubic meters) were ready for operation at the end of 2010 and were gradually put into operation in January 2011, which added more storage capacity for the trans-shipment business. An explosion and subsequent fires occurred at one of the crude oil pipelines of Dalian PetroChina International Warehousing and Transportation Co., Ltd. (“Dalian PetroChina Warehousing”) in the Xingang area on 16 July 2010 (“7.16 Explosion Accident”). The 7.16 Explosion Accident temporarily affected the operation of the Group’s oil terminal and trans-shipment business. While proactively assisting relevant parties in dealing with the emergency and participating in cleaning the oil spill, the Group made extraordinary efforts in resuming its operations. Operations at the Group’s terminals, which were stopped due to the accident, gradually resumed as usual from 20 July 2010 to 28 July 2010. In terms of operations on land, the transportation via pipeline from Taoyuan storage area to PatroChina Dalian Branch and from national storage tanks to PetroChina Dalian Branch and WEPEC resumed. In addition, the Group added temporary pipelines to resume operations of storage tanks in Nanhai Phase II area (with a total capacity of 600,000 cubic meters). All the above measures ensured the Group’s customers’ needs in loading and unloading, storage and trans-shipment services were met. The following table sets out the container throughput handled by the Group in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 TEUs) (’000 TEUs) Other ports (note 1) Other ports (note 1) (0.9%) Other ports (note 1) Note 1: Throughput at other ports refers to an aggregate of the throughput of (Jinzhou New Age Container Terminal Co., Ltd.), which is owned as to 15% by the Group and (Qinhuangdao Port New Harbour Container Terminal Co., Ltd.), which is owned as to 15% by the Group. In 2010, in terms of container throughput, the Group handled a total of approximately 6.337 million TEUs, an increase of 15.5% over 2009. In Dalian, the Group handled approximately 5.242 million TEUs, an increase of 18.7% over 2009, of which container throughput for foreign trade increased by 13.8% and container throughput for domestic trade increased by 40.2%. The growth in container business for foreign trade was mainly due to the favourable situation of foreign trade and the Group’s enhanced cargo solicitation in its hinterland for foreign trade and trans-shipment businesses. Benefiting from the rapid growth in domestic trade, the Group continued to develop the domestic market so as to maintain fast growth in the container business for domestic trade. The container volume of sea-to-rail intermodal transportation handled by the Group reached approximately 291,000 TEUs, an increase of 15.0% over the 2009 total. The volume of trans-shipment containers handled by the Group was 613,000 TEUs, an increase of 26.0% over the 2009 total. In 2010, the Group’s container terminal business represented 99.7% (96% in 2009) of the total market in Dalian and 62% (65% in 2009) of the market in the Three Northeastern Provinces. The Group’s container throughput for foreign trade accounted for 100% (100% in 2009) of the total volume in Dalian and 96.7% (97% in 2009) of the total in the Three Northeastern Provinces. In 2010, the revenue from container terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB467,195,000 which represented an increase of RMB83,092,000 or 21.6% as compared with the revenue in 2009. Such increase was mainly caused by the increase of income from land use rights transfer, and the increase of container-related logistics services driven by foreign trade’s recovery and by the Group’s market development efforts. In 2010, the revenue from container terminal and logistics services accounted for 14.1% (12.7% in 2009) of the Company’s total revenue. In 2010, the gross profit from container terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB173,963,000 which increased by 89.4% as compared with RMB91,862,000 in 2009, accounting for 13.2% (8.2% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and representing a gross margin of 37.2% (23.9% in 2009). Such increase in gross margin was mainly caused by the increase in the high- margin business of the transfer of land use rights. In 2010, the major measures taken and the progress of major projects related to the Group’s Container Segment were as follows: In terms of container business for foreign trade, the Group actively captured the opportunities that were appearing in the shipping cargo market for foreign trade and enhanced market development, which led major shipping companies to increase investment in existing ocean shipping routes and develop new shipping routes to achieve volume growth. As a result, the Group effectively prevented ocean cargo from being trans-shipped at terminals other than the Group’s ports, strengthened its position as a transportation hub, and consolidated its position as a leading container terminal operator for foreign trade in the Three Northeastern Provinces. In terms of container business for domestic trade, the Group continued to develop its business by implementing market-oriented strategies and promoting construction of key projects, and achieve sound growth. In 2010, the Group’s container throughput for domestic trade continued to increase rapidly, a significant contribution to the Group’s overall container throughput. The Group actively solicited cargos in its hinterland and attracted shipping companies to introduce two additional new truck routes for domestic trade so as to improve the shipping routes’ destinations and capacity. The Group also continued to promote the construction of logistics systems for domestic trade. The bulk cargo containerization projects were promoted in both inland areas and ports at the same time. The Group expanded its competitive services into its hinterland and provided its customers with the most convenient services. The Group continued to promote the construction of extended service systems, with a focus on trans-shipment and sea-to-rail transportation services. In terms of trans-shipment via the sea, the Group enhanced co-operation with shipping companies and personalised its services to ensure a stable channel for the trans-shipment business via the sea. The Group promoted the concept of personalised professional services and continued to develop the international trans-shipment business so that it maintained steady operation of the international trans-shipment routes linked to the Mediterranean Sea. The Group continually enhanced its investment in shipping capacity for feeder services in Bohai Rim, and paid attention to improving its customer service and its capacity in feeder routes. The Group’s feeder routes network was further improved and the trans-shipment business for domestic trade achieved rapid growth. In terms of sea-to-rail transportation, the Group accurately captured market demand, improved function and services of inland depot projects, continued to improve its rail routes service, actively developed new rail service routes, promoted the balanced development of two-way rail routes, and better controlled the cargo market in the hinterland through excellent rail route service and operational capability. On 18 July 2010, the Dalian Railway Container Logistics Centre was put into trial operation, which highly improved the capability of cargo solicitation for container sea-to-rail business in Dalian and the Group’s service quality. The Group paid great attention to optimization of the port environment to ensure a conducive environment for the Group’s business development. The Group co-ordinated with Dalian’s Customs officials to complete a new logistics monitoring system and IT system switch so as to improve the efficiency of customs clearance. The Group aimed at improving its customers’ benefits, actively coordinating with Liaoning Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, expanding the scope of vessels’ power inspection services and reducing vessels’ calling time at the port. The Group’s successful service of the largest container vessel in the world (with a total capacity of 14,038 TEUs) demonstrated its ability to handle ultra-arge container vessels. The Group continued to proceed with the construction of new container berths and related logistics depots in Dayao Bay Phase II and Phase III. In 2010, the aforesaid construction of berths progress steadily and the specialized yards and stations for dangerous cargo were also under construction. Following completion of the construction of container-related specialized berths and ancillary facilities in the Dayao Bay area, the container handling capacity in the Dayao Bay area and the Group’s service level will be significantly upgraded, better serving the development of the Group’s container business. The Group continued to proceed with the construction of inland container logistics systems in northeastern China. The Dalian Railway Container Logistics Centre commenced operation in July 2010. The Muling Logistics Centre is under construction. The construction of the Harbin Railway Container Logistics Centre and Dehui Logistics Station also made progress. Following the commencement of construction or operation of the container centres, inland dry ports and specialised depots in the Group’s hinterland in northeastern China, the Group improved the efficiency of its container intermodal transportation network so that it is able to provide more convenient services for its hinterland customers and maintain its customers and its cargo volume. The following table sets out the throughput handled by the Group’s automobile terminal in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: Increase/ (Decrease) Vehicles (units) Equipments (tonnes) (16.1%) In 2010, the Group handled a total of 121,011 vehicles at its automobile terminal, a significant increase of 141% over In terms of automobile business for foreign trade, due to the impact of the great increase of imported automobiles in China, the Group’s volume of foreign trade imports achieved a significant increase of 97% over 2009. The Group’s volume of exports showed a large increase of 173% over 2009 due to its continuing business expansion. The Group formed two stable exporting shipping routes with Hafei’s exported cargos as a base to further enhance Dalian’s position as an exporting base port. In terms of automobile business for domestic trade, this benefited from the rapid growth of automobile production and sales in China and the Group’s active market development and frequency on both of the Group’s current two shipping routes increased compared with 2009. The volume handled by the Group from east China and south China to north China increased by 68% over 2009 and the volume handled by the Group from its hinterland to south China increased rapidly by 414% over 2009. Relying on the above two shipping routes, Dalian is positioning itself as a hub port for domestic trade in north China, and has achieved its preliminary goals. The decrease in equipment throughput handled by the Group was mainly due to the decrease in cargo volume in the hinterland. In 2010, the vehicles handled by the Group accounted for 88.7% (92% in 2009) of the total volume in northeastern China. During 2010, the Company’s share of the profits in its automobile terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB2,562,000, representing an increase of RMB9,997,000 over a loss of RMB7,435,000 in 2009. The improvement of this segment is mainly due to the fast growth of both vehicle production and sales and the effects of market development. In 2010, the major measures taken and the progress of major projects related to the Group’s Automobile Terminal Segment were as follows: The Group promoted an increase in frequency on Guangzhou Hongda’s shipping route to two times per week and Shanghai Automobile’s shipping route to three times per week. The increase in shipping frequency brought more cargos from south China and, at the same time, also built a foundation for shipping large-scale cargos in the Group’s hinterland. In 2010, the transportation between south China and north China was stable and the trans-shipped volume handled by the Group reached a total of 88,000 vehicles. In terms of automobile business for foreign trade, the Group handled over 1,000 agricultural machines imported to its hinterland. The large- sized agricultural machines needed longer periods for storage, which generated high-margin revenues for the Group; the Group actively expanded into other kinds of exporting businesses in its hinterland, and as a result, the Group handled about 2,000 exported vehicles in addition to the operation of Hafei’s shipping route two times per month. The Group has made great progress in terms of co-operation with major customers. In December 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Chery Automobile Corporation Limited and Beijing Changjiu Logistics Co., Ltd. to establish a joint venture company with an aim to provide Chery with complete logistics services of vehicles and components in the initial stage and gradually develop into a leading public logistics service provider in China. The Group entered into a cooperation agreement with Anji Automotive Logistics Co., Ltd., controlled by SAIC Group, to carry out co-operation in the field of automobile logistics, taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the expected launch of the Company’s first 2,300-car Ro-Ro vessel in the near future. The Group’s railway siding at its automobile terminal passed inspection and was put into trial operation in the second half of 2010. In 2010, the Group operated four scheduled trains handling a total of 1,360 vehicles. The start of the operation of the Group’s two newly ordered roll-on and roll-off vessels was postponed. The vessels will be put into operation at the end of April and the beginning of September 2011, respectively. The following table sets out the throughput handled by the Group’s ore terminal in 2010 and its comparative results in Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) (64.5%) In 2010, the Group’s ore terminal handled approximately 28.239 million tonnes of ore, a slight increase of 1.8% over 2009, of which the imported volume for foreign trade was about 18.79 million tonnes, a decrease of 10.8% from the total of 2009. Facing the situation of lack of cargo due to decrease in demand for imported ore from steel companies in northeastern China and the competition from the surrounding ports, on one hand, the Group leveraged its advantage of capably handling large-sized vessels with high efficiency and low wastage to capture cargo solicitation of steel companies in the Group’s hinterland in northeastern China; on the other hand, the Group continued to enhance its trans-shipment cargo solicitation for cargo destined for the Hebei Province, Jinzhou and other places. As a result, the ore throughput recorded a slight increase. In 2010, the Group’s ore throughput accounted for 37.5% (41.3% in 2009) of the total throughput in northeastern China. In 2010, the revenue from ore terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB304,994,000, which represented an increase of RMB1,345,000 or 0.4% over the 2009 total revenue. In 2010, the revenue from ore terminal and logistics services accounted for 9.0% (10.1% in 2009) of the Company’s total revenue. In 2010, the gross profit from ore terminal and logistics services amounted to RMB110,192,000 which decreased by 6.5% from RMB117,849,000 in 2009, accounted for 8.3% (10.5% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and represented a gross margin of 36.1% (38.8% in 2009). The gross margin decreased because the growth of the rate of cost was higher than that of the revenue. In 2010, the major measures taken by the Group and the progress of major projects related to the Group’s Ore Segment were as follows: The Group visited its customers frequently, provided personalised services and strengthened its relationship with major customers so that it achieved stable cargo volume. In addition, the Group enhanced its market development by leveraging its geographic location and nature deep-water ports. As a result, the Group handled a total of 31 voyages of ore carriers each with a 300,000-tonne capacity, an increase of 14 voyages over the 2009 total. The Group enhanced communication with railway companies to obtain more railcars to increase its transportation capacity. In 2010, the Group handled a total of nearly 200,000 trains, achieving various records in terms of monthly dispatching volume, daily dispatching volume and a single dispatching volume. The Group continued to stabilize cargo supply in the hinterland in northeastern China. The Group paid great attention to the progress of Anling’s projects in Chaoyang, monitoring import activities to successfully solicit cargo supply. In addition, the Group enhanced its cooperation with other ports in the hinterland to seek suitable trans-shipment vessels for its customers for sea transport. At the same time, the Group implemented market development strategies of “not only relying on northeastern China, but also markets outside northeastern China” to capture trans-shipment cargo solicitation from Hebei Province. The Group actively proceeded with the construction of the imported ore logistics centre and developed feasible cooperation plans. The following table sets out the throughput handled by the Group’s general cargo terminal in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: 31 December Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) (28.5%) In 2010, the Group’s general cargo terminal handled approximately 27.54 million tonnes, an increase of 19.5% over the 2009 total. In 2010, the volume of steel handled by the Group was approximately 8.392 million tonnes, a slight increase of 2.1% over the 2009 total. Although a series of control measures implemented by China’s government were not favourable to the steel industry, which caused a flat increase in volume of the steel companies in northeastern China compared with 2009, the Group leveraged its ice- free port advantages and established liner shipping routes and long-term cooperation with steel companies in the hinterland to ensure increases in steel volume. In 2010, the volume of coal handled by the Group was approximately 8.615 million tonnes, an increase of 7% over the 2009 total. The main reasons for the increase were the stabilization in the consumption of two major customers, Huaneng Power Plant and Zhuanghe Power Plant, success of handling the coal diverted from the other ports, and a significant increase in consumption volume of some enterprises around Changxing Island. In 2010, the volume of equipment handled by the Group was approximately 1.021 million tonnes, a significant increase of 66% over the 2009 total. It was mainly due to the continuous rapid growth of the equipment manufacturing industry in northeastern China and the enhancement of market development through cooperation with shipping companies. In 2010, the volume of packed grain handled by the Group was approximately 942,000 tonnes, a decrease of 28.5% from the 2009 total. The decrease was mainly due to the growing trend of bulk grain, which resulted in a proportionate decrease for the packed grain. In 2010, the steel throughput and coal throughput handled by the Group’s ore terminal accounted for 21.8% (21.6% in 2009) and 12.9% (14.7% in 2009) of the total throughput in northeastern China, respectively. In 2010, the revenue from general cargo terminal operation services amounted to RMB310,932,000 which represented a increase of RMB17,008,000 or 5.8% as compared with the revenue in 2009. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in throughout of all types of cargo and the increase in handling charges. In 2010, the revenue from general cargo terminal operation services accounted for 9.4% (9.7% in 2009) of the Company’s total revenue. In 2010, the gross profit from general cargo terminal operation services amounted to RMB18,351,000 which increased by 3.36 times as compared with RMB4,207,000 in 2009, accounted for 1.4% (0.4% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profits, and represented a gross margin of 5.9% (1.4% in 2009). Such increase in gross margin was mainly due to the increase in handling charges and throughput. In 2010, the major measures taken by the Group and the progress of related major projects were as follows: In 2010, the Group enhanced cargo solicitation from the steel companies in the hinterland through visiting customers and improving transportation service quality. At the same time, the Group made an adjustment of tariffs for certain customers and as a result, achieved growth in both volume and revenue. The Group thoroughly analysed the relationships of its customers along with the logistics chains. Based on the analysis, the Group co-operated with steel companies in the hinterland to maintain sound relationships with its end customers by designing complete logistics systems to attract more customers to trans-ship their cargos via the Group’s general cargo terminal. While maintaining stable operation of the general cargo shipping route between Dalian and Incheon, the Group explored a competitive steel shipping route between Dalian and Shanghai through discussions with steel companies in the hinterland in order to reduce trans-shipment times and tariffs and attract more customers. In addition, the Group, through co-operation with shipping companies, introduced a shipping route between Dalian and India for exporting equipment. Based on the overall arrangement, the Group relocated the coal cargo from its bulk grain terminal at Ganjingzi area to its general cargo terminal in the Dalian Bay area. In order to complete the relocation successfully and ensure the stabilization of the Group’s cargo as a whole, the Group actively coordinated with various parties, provided yards exclusively for such customers, strictly implemented handling process standards and ensured smooth production processes to maintain customers. The Group took advantage of its capability of handling large-sized equipment to capture the opportunity in China of promoting exported equipment. The Group built its brand through its high-quality and high-efficiency services. The Group attracted a lot of customers to trans-ship via the Group’s terminal. In addition, the Group successfully handled large-sized equipment with weight 1,536 tonnes and value of up to US$600 million for a single piece. The Group enhanced its cooperation with railway companies. As a result, the railway siding in the Changxing Island area was put into operation in December 2010, which had a significant positive effect on the growth of the Group’s general cargo business in this area. At the same time, the Group entered cooperation contracts with railway companies at various port areas so as to bring more stable cargos to the Group. The Group entered or extended yard leasing contracts with many customers in the Changxing Island area to turn its land resources into new revenue growth points to ensure resource usage sustainability. The Group achieved revenue growth and extension of services at the same time through such diversified efforts. The following table sets out the throughput handled by the Group’s bulk grain terminal in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 tonnes) (’000 tonnes) (58.1%) (9.5%) In 2010, the throughput handled by the Group’s bulk grain terminal was approximately 6.42 million tonnes, a decrease of 9.5% from the 2009 total. In 2010, the Group’s corn throughput increased by 4.2% over the 2009 total, to 3.48 million tonnes. The increase in the corn throughput was mainly due to the following reasons: on one hand, the Group used the opportunity of the Chinese government’s corn allowance policies in the first half of 2010, benefited from its grain logistics system, coordinated actively with railway companies, shipping companies and other relevant parties, and improved the efficiency of its logistics resources usage and cargo turnovers; on the other hand, the Group implemented proactive market development policies, closely co- operated with corn suppliers and purchasers, and provided high-quality logistics services and value-added services. In 2010, the Group’s soy bean throughput was approximately 1.274 million tonnes, a significant increase of 91.9% over the 2009 total, and the imported grain throughput for foreign trade comprised approximately 1.186 million tonnes, an increase of 86.2% over the 2009 total. Such growth was mainly due to the following reasons: on one hand, leveraging the Group’s improved grain storage capacity, enhancing cooperation with soy bean exporters and processing enterprises to expand the soy bean trans-shipment business; on the other hand, due to the gradual recovery of the domestic economy, the production capacity of the edible oil industry continually expanded and the market demand for soy beans increased significantly. In 2010, the Group’s barley throughput was approximately 343,000 tonnes, an increase of 39.4% over the 2009 total, of which imported barley throughput for foreign trade was approximately 339,000 tonnes, an increase of 46.8% over the 2009 total. Driven by the favourable situation of the domestic economy, the demand for beer increased in China, which drove a steady increase in imports of barley. At the same time, the Group coordinated with customs authorities, inspection organizations, railway companies and other relevant parties to ensure a smooth and efficient process of barley trans-shipment. As a result, the Group achieved a 100% market share for imported barley in Dalian. In 2010, the Group’s wheat throughput was approximately 169,000 tonnes, an increase of 89.9% over the 2009 total. This significant growth was mainly due to wheat exchange, relocation and auction activities of the national wheat reserve base in Dalian. In 2010, the Group’s other cargo throughput was approximately 1.154 million tonnes, a decrease of 58.1% from the 2009 total. Such decrease was mainly due to the Group’s depot at the Ganjingzi area ceasing operations, as the result of the local government zoning requirements and the Group’s resulting adjustment of its production locations. Cargos originally handed at the Ganjingzi area were relocated to the Group’s other terminals. In 2010, the throughput handled by the Group’s bulk grain terminal accounted for 16.7% (17.2% in 2009) of the total throughput in northeastern China. In 2010, the revenue from bulk grain terminal operation services amounted to RMB267,638,000 which represented an increase of RMB72,011,000 or 36.8% as compared with the revenue in 2009. Such increase was mainly due to handling charge increases and changes in the composition of cargo handled. In 2010, the revenue from bulk grain terminal operation services accounted for 8.1% (6.5% in 2009) of the Company’s total revenue. In 2010, the gross profit from bulk grain terminal operation services amounted to RMB100,768,000, representing an increase of 1.32 times as compared with RMB43,363,000 in 2009; this accounted for 7.6% (3.9% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and represented a gross margin of 37.7% (22.2% in 2009). Such increase in gross margin was mainly caused by the increase of handling charges and freight rates. In 2010, the major measures taken by the Group and the progress of major projects related to the Group’s Bulk Grain Segment were as follows: Benefiting from the transportation allowance policies in the first half of 2010, the Group enhanced close cooperation with certain grain enterprises directly owned by the central government, and took advantage of its grain logistics system, including bulk grain carriages, silos and shipping routes to improve corn cargo turnovers. Facing the termination of the allowance policies and the unfavourable development of the State’s direct import action of corn into southern China, the Group took full advantage of the grain trading platform around the Dalian port to increase the trading volume and the trans-shipment volume to ensure a stable increase in terms of corn throughput. In terms of the trans-shipment business for foreign trade, the Group actively expanded the trans- shipment business for soy bean and barley. On one hand, the Group focused on cooperation with major grain import agencies to capture the opportunities of grain import channels at the early stage. On the other hand, the Group enhanced communication with enterprises processing soy beans and barley to solicit cargo from the end purchasers. In 2010, the imported grain for foreign trade handled by the Group was approximately 1.524 million tonnes, an increase of 75.4% over the 2009 total. The Group proactively communicated with railway companies and railway car manufacturers to promote its new fleet of 500 bulk grain carriages. Some of the carriages commenced operation at the end of 2010 and all of them had been put into operation by January 2011. These resources significantly eased the bottleneck problem for grain cargo transportation from its production area to its place of consumption, and further improved the Group’s cargo solicitation capability. The Group closely co-operated with the State grain reserve’s Dalian depot, to construct bulk grain silos (with a total capacity of 100,000 tonnes) in the Ganjingzi area. Phase I of the project has been put into operation with a designed capacity of 30,000 tonnes, and the construction of Phase II has commenced and is expected to be put into operation in the second half of 2011 with a designed capacity of 70,000 tonnes. The following table sets out the passenger and roll-on roll-off throughput handled by the Group in 2010 and its comparative results in 2009: Increase/ (Decrease) (’000 persons) (13.8%) Vehicles (’000 units) (Note 2) Note 2: Vehicles refer to the vehicles handled at the passenger and roll-on, roll-off terminals of the Group and companies in which it has invested. In 2010, the Group transported approximately 3.037 million passengers, a decrease of 13.8% over the 2009 total, and handled approximately 512,000 vehicles, an increase of 11.5% over the 2009 total. In 2010, the passengers and cargos increased in the Bohai Rim, after initially declining. Due to the impacts of climate and shortage of labor in the coastal areas of north China, the traffic volume of passengers and cargos did not reach the level initially expected. At the same time, the commencement of operation of two ultra-large Ro- Ro passenger vessels in the Bohai Rim negatively affected transportation prices during the peak seasons in spring and summer, which diverted cargo from the Group’s terminals. In the second half of 2010, due to three Ro-Ro passenger vessels ceasing operation gradually in the Bohai Rim and the fourth quarter being a peak season, both the prices and the traffic volume increased. These factors contributed to the increase in the Group’s throughput. In 2010, the revenue from passenger and roll-on, roll- off and logistics services amounted to RMB75,032,000, which represented an increase of RMB1,107,000 or 1.5% over the 2009 total. Such increase was mainly driven by the increase of the Ro-Ro throughput. In 2010, the revenue from passenger and roll-on, roll- off and logistics services accounted for 2.3% of the Company’s total revenue (2.4% in 2009). In 2010, the gross profit from passenger and roll-on, roll- off and logistics services amounted to RMB39,740,000, an increase of 7.2% from RMB37,065,000 in 2009, accounting for 3.0% (3.3% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and representing a gross margin of 53.0% (50.1% in 2009). Such increase in the gross margin was mainly caused by the effective control of operating costs. In 2010, the major measures taken by the Group and the progress of major projects related to the Group’s Passenger and Ro-Ro Segment were as follows: The Group collected market information on passengers and cargos in a timely manner in order to facilitate its marketing of its services. The Group collected market information of passengers and cargos via various channels in the hinterland, northeastern China and Shandong Province, to develop market knowledge and guide its provision of services. The Group focused on marketing shipping schedules to increase its market share. The Group optimized its intermodal transportation system to provide convenient services to passengers and other customers. By taking into consideration the fluctuation in the number of passengers and vehicle traffic on various holidays, including the Qingming Festival, the Labor Day holiday, the Dragon Boat Festival and the National Day Golden Week holiday, the Group coordinated in advance with shipping companies to make appropriate arrangements in various respects, including schedules, capacities and ticket selling services so as to maximize the number of passengers and cargo volume and better serve passengers and other customers. The Group successfully met the transportation needs of its customers during the Chinese Spring Festival by enhancing its market promotions, improving its services and ensuring safety. The Group made great efforts in providing transportation during the summer of 2010. The Group enhanced communication with shipping companies and other port operators to plan reasonable shipping schedules to satisfy passengers’ demands. Secondly, the Group enhanced its market knowledge, timely collecting market information via various channels, and guiding operations in an orderly manner. Thirdly, the Group enhanced the administration of ticket selling services and port operations to ensure safe, orderly, high-efficiency and high-quality transportation services during the summer. The Group successfully resumed services on the “Dalian-Tianjin” route on 15 June 2010 by actively coordinating with China Shipping and Tianjin Port. The Group continued to develop new channels for its ticket selling services and expanded its market share. In addition, the Group enhanced arrangement for groups of passengers, in order to boost its market share. In 2010, the port services, ocean engineering and shipbuilding industries recorded a stable performance. The Group paid great attention to communication with its customers and improvement in tugging services to achieve sound growth in the tugging business in Dalian. In the market outside Dalian, facing changing market conditions, the Group timely changed tugboats’ location and optimized tugging services so that it maintained a stable long-term customer base and developed relationships with customers. As at the end of 2010, the Group had a total of 39 tugboats and four pilot boats and retained a leading tugging services position amongst all port operators in China. Among these vessels, 14 tugboats were leased out under long-term leases to other ports outside Dalian. The construction of the Group’s eight newly-ordered tugboats was completed. In addition, the Group bought four tugboats and two pilot boats into operation in 2010. The total tallying throughput handled by the Group was approximately 35.573 million tonnes, an increase of 12.9% over the 2009 total. Comprehensive port transportation and The Company’s branch company, Dalian Port Railway Company, uses railways as its primary mode of providing transportation to and from Dalian Port, and they are an important part of the Company’s comprehensive transportation and logistics system. In 2010, in terms of railway transportation operation, the Group handled a total of 680,000 tonnes of cargo, an increase of 7.1% over the 2009 total. Construction management and supervision In 2010, in terms of construction management, the Group worked on 22 key port constructions projects, and eight of them were completed by the end of 2010, which provided strong support to the development of the port’s logistics services. Dalian Port Construction and Supervision & Consultation Co., Ltd. (owned as to 75% by the Company) successful completed the audit for the revision of its Quality Management System and the audit for the recertification of its Environment Management System and Occupation Health Safety Management System and was awarded the title of Mode Supervision Company by the Association of Engineering Consultants of Liaoning Province. In 2010, the Group provided power supply services of 203 million kWh, an increase of 29.7 million kWh or 17% as compared with the 2009 total. In 2010, in terms of IT services, while providing reliable services to internal customers, the Group also expanded its external market, and achieved sound progress in its business. In 2010, the revenue from port value-added services amounted to RMB898,006,000, which represented an increase of RMB116,614,000 or 14.9% over the 2009 total. This revenue increase was mainly attributable to the rapid development of the various port value-added services; in particular, revenue from tugging services and sales of electricity increased significantly. In 2010, the revenue from port value-added services accounted for 27.1% of the Company’s total revenue (25.9% in 2009). In 2010, the gross profit from port value-added services amounted to RMB323,299,000, an increase of 9.2% from RMB296,044,000 in 2009, accounting for 24.4% (26.3% in 2009) of the Company’s total gross profit, and representing a gross margin of 36.0% (37.9% in 2009). The gross margin decreased mainly due to the increase of depreciation of new assets as well as operation costs. Human resources are important and talented staff are essential for the success of an enterprise. Staff are the most valuable resource of the Company and the key factor for the Company’s continuous development. In 2010, to attract and retain talented personnel, the Company further improved its human resources management in various respects, including career development, remuneration and working environment having taken into consideration the Company’s development strategies and changing external human resources policies. The Company paid great attention to the career development of its staff. In order to continuously improve their professional skills, all- round development and team performance, the Group provided various training programs to its staff in different classes and at different levels by itself or through outside training service providers, as well as holding technical skill competitions for its staff. The Group has improved the human resources management system, established the authorization system and control procedures for the management of human resources so as to ensure human resources management is carried out according to established rules and standards and effectively manages risks. In addition, based on the principle of fairness and competitiveness and by taking into consideration labour market conditions, the Company has further refined and optimized its employee compensation system and incentive mechanism by linking their compensation with the Company’s performance to ensure that employees are able to share the success of the Company. In 2010, the Company was granted the titles of “Mode Enterprise in Harmonious Labour Relationship” and “AAA Corporation in Compliance with the Labour Security Laws and Regulations”. As at 31 December 2010, the Group had a total of 6,137 full-time employees. The Group and its invested businesses together had a total of 7,863 employees. The Group undertakes review of its employee remuneration policy annually by taking into account the Group’s financial performance, staff annual appraisal results and the labor market in Dalian. The Company always attaches great importance to the investor relation management. Adhering to the principles of regularity, fairness and transparency of information disclosure, the Company has various channels for information disclosure to investors to allow them to have a good understanding of the Company’s business performance and future development strategies. In addition, the Company has taken initiatives to collect feedback from investors, carefully consider their suggestions and make appropriate investor relationship improvements.

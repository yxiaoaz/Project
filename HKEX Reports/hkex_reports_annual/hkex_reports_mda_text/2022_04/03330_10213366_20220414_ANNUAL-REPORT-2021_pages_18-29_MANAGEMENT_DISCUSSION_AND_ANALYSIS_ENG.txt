Moreover, the metal grade of primary metal mined and produced, was lower due to market influences, leading to the decreasing volume of gold bullion processed from gold concentrates. As a result of the above, the production volume of gold bullion decreased by 526 kg. In addition, the smelting segment recorded a decrease in the revenue due to the dramatical decrease of the international gold prices during the first half year of 2021. The smelting segment recorded a loss of approximately RMB7,069,000 for the Fiscal Year 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020: profit of approximately RMB185,192,000), which was due to the dramatical decrease of the international gold prices during the first half year of 2021. The Group has continued the strict implementation of cost reduction and efficiency enhancement measures. The gold refining electrolysis renovation project of the smelting branch was completed and put into production ahead of schedule, shortening the compound gold processing cycle from 3 days to 1 day. The ball mill expansion project was completed and put into operation on schedule, doubling the fine slag processing capacity. The cyanide-containing wastewater desalination project and the renovation of the Isa Mill were progressing smoothly as planned and would become a “source of motivation” for enhancing efficiency upon completion and commencement of operation. The consumption of auxiliary materials in the production process was effectively reduced by rectifying the “bleeding point” of waste of auxiliary materials, thus achieving cost reduction and efficiency enhancement. Jinda Gold’s pre-sale of gold TD increased unit selling prices and increased operational efficiencies. Annual Report 2021 LINGBAO GOLD GROUP COMPANY LTD.

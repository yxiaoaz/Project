(RMB Million) (RMB Million) (RMB Million) CCI 5000K thermal coal price index 2021 Note: Data retrieved from sxcoal.com ( ). The publication of the index was suspended during 3 December 2020 to 7 February 2021, 11 to 23 May 2021 and 31 May to 8 July 2021, as there were abnormal fluctuations in the market price of coal. Illustration of the Structure of Customers (By Revenue): In 2021, the global economy is gradually recovering from the tremendous impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, but the economic recovery is still constrained by the recurrence of the epidemic, energy shortage and high inflation. In the face of the complicated international environment and the instability of the epidemic, the Chinese government insisted on the general keynote of seeking progress in a stable manner, strengthening the cross-cycle adjustment of macroeconomic policies and increasing the support for the real economy, the national economy continued to recover and the economic growth rate was among the highest in the world’s major economies, achieving a good start for the “14th five-year” plan. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China’s GDP in 2021 was approximately RMB114.4 trillion, representing an increase of 8.1% year-on-year; industrial enterprises above the national scale achieved a business revenue of approximately RMB127.9 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 19.4%; industrial enterprises above the national scale achieved a total profit of approximately RMB8,709.21 billion, a year- on-year increase of 34.3%. 2021 was an extraordinary year for the coal industry. After the pandemic, the domestic economy recovered rapidly, and coal demand remained strong. Due to the continuing implementation of policy on limitation on production capacity, the production volume lacked flexibility, and the supply and demand were seriously mismatched, resulting in a significant gap. The overall demand for coal increased significantly. With the continuous recovery of the domestic economy, the demand for downstream power generation maintained a high growth rate. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the national industrial power generation above designated size in 2021 was approximately 8,112.2 billion kWh, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.1%. On the supply side, China’s total coal supply and import volume increased, but the growth rate was lower than that of the demand side. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2021, the production volume of industrial raw coal above designated size in China was approximately 4.07 billion tonnes, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.7%. During the same year, China imported approximately 320 million tonnes of coal, representing a year-on-year increase of 6.6%. In 2021, the overall coal price showed the trend of “sharp increase followed by a sharp decrease, and a fluctuation in high-level”, and the price centre rose sharply compared with previous years, hitting a historical peak. The high coal prices in 2021 drove the growth of the overall efficiency of the industry. According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2021, the national large-scale coal mining and washing enterprises achieved revenue from principal business of approximately RMB5,704.87 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 41.9%, and a total profit of approximately RMB1,039.08 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 190.7%. In conclusion, the mismatch between coal supply and demand in 2021 has resulted in a significant increase in coal prices in general, which has contributed to a significant increase in the overall profit of coal enterprises and resulted a boom in the industry. As a leading integrated coal enterprise in China, the Group’s business activities operate through the whole coal industry chain, covering coal production, washing, loading, transportation and trading. In 2021, the Group followed the market rules and continued to strengthen the development of end customers and new customers with its own low-sulfur and high-quality brand products “Kinetic 2”. The Group continued to carry out various purchase and sales modes such as Free on Board, Delivered Ex Quay and Free on Trains, and timely carried out on-site sales during the overhaul of the Daqin Line, effectively extending the influence of “Kinetic 2” in the downstream. In 2021, the Group exceeded its sales volume and sales targets. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recorded a total revenue of approximately RMB5,580.7 million, representing an increase of 88.4% as compared to the corresponding period of last year. In 2021, coal prices repeatedly hit record high. The Group scientifically studied and judged the market trend, combined the spot sales at prof and presales under a high price environment, gave priority to high-quality customers with high performance and good reputation, and locked in the sales profits of medium and long-term at a high price. In May 2021, the Group established a sales risk control team to formulate a risk control plan to protect the Group’s business in a complex market environment. In 2021, the average selling price per tonne of the Group’s 5,000 kcal low-sulfur environmentally friendly thermal coal was approximately RMB813, representing a year-on-year increase of approximately 59.7%. In 2021, the Group continued to implement refined management, formulated and improved various systems in various operation links, and strived to control various production and management costs. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group achieved a gross profit margin of approximately 64.6%, maintaining an above-average standard in the industry. Based on the above business strategies, the Group has achieved breakthrough development in 2021, bringing considerable profit returns to shareholders. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group’s consolidated net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company amounted to approximately RMB2,468.6 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 203.0%. The Group’s EBITDA amounted to approximately RMB3,557.3 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 162.1%. In addition, the Group has always adhered to the concept of safe and efficient production, continued to promote the construction of automation platforms such as network infrastructure platform and integrated management and control platform, and there were no serious personal injury accidents throughout the year. The Group’s Dafanpu Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia has maintained the honour of “Class A Coal Mine” in Zhunge’er Banner for seven consecutive years, and has been rated as “Coal Industry Premium Safe and Efficient Mine” by the China National Coal Association since 2014. The Group also attaches great importance to environmental protection and sustainable development. In July 2021, the Dafanpu Coal Mine successfully passed the national green mine improvement acceptance, and continued to maintain the national green mine honor; In October of the same year, the Group successfully passed the green mine construction inspection by the Ordos Natural Resources Bureau, which fully demonstrated the Group’s comprehensive strength in sustainable development of the mining industry. In recent years, the Group has successfully established an ecological industrial chain integrating agricultural product planting, fruit wine production and livestock breeding in the mine reclamation area. On the basis of the steady growth of the principal business of coal, the Company will develop the ancillary business of agriculture and animal husbandry to seek more profit returns for shareholders. The COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020 has brought about additional uncertainties in the Group’s operating environment and has impacted the Group’s operations and financial position. The Group has been closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic developments on the Group’s businesses and has put in place responsive measures. These responsive measures include safeguarding production to ensure the coal market supply in accordance with the arrangement of government authorities while maintaining strict pandemic monitoring and control and safety production measures, negotiating with customers on delivery schedule, and continuously monitoring the operations of our customers. As far as the Group’s businesses are concerned, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have material negative impact on the Group’s production as the production had been resumed since early February 2020, the Group will keep its responsive measures under review as the situation evolves. Our operations are currently centered at the Dafanpu Coal Mine and most of our operating cash flows and sales are derived from the sale of coal produced from this single deposit. Any significant operational or other difficulties in the mining, processing, storing or transportation of coal at or from the Dafanpu Coal Mine could reduce, disrupt or halt our coal production, which materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations (including mining, processing, storing, rail transportation and coal trading) have run smoothly since the commencement of commercial production in 2013. Besides, we always focus on the production safety of the Dafanpu Coal Mine and it is expected that the operations would become more stable in the future as we accumulate more operational experience. Influenced by the effect of structural adjustments on this sector and a centralised allocation of production capacity, there is still a substantial downward pressure on the prices of our products. The Group will maintain sales volumes and profits by various measures, including reducing costs and exploring potential internally, expanding markets and improving efficiency externally, profoundly optimizing market layout, expanding market space, flexibly implementing marketing strategy and product mix optimization. In addition, our quality coal product brand “Kinetic 2” enjoys great popularity, which mitigates risks arising from coal price volatility. The principal business of the Group is of high risk in nature with high safety and production related risks, and there are many uncertainties that affect safety production. The Group always believes that safety comes first and precaution is key, underpinning the safety monitoring system with “scientific management, sophisticated organization and practical measures” to strengthen risk management and conduct safety accountability assessment in a stringent manner to ensure the production with high operating efficiency and safety. In 2021, the Group’s Dafanpu Coal Mine had zero injury or casualty. Work that minimizes the risks in respect of production safety are detailed in the Environmental, Social and Governance Report set out on pages 24 to 56 of this annual report. The estimated coal resources and reserves with no material change of assumptions as compared with previously disclosed estimates, substantiated by the internal experts were as follows: Coal Resources as of 31 December 2021 (Million tonnes) (Million tonnes) (Million tonnes) (Million tonnes) Coal Reserves as of 31 December 2021 Proven Coal Probable Coal Total Coal (Million tonnes) (Million tonnes) (Million tonnes) For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group entered into a number of contracts in relation to acquisition, building construction in Dafanpu Coal Mine and other projects and the purchase of machinery and equipment. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s outstanding capital commitments amounted to approximately RMB644.8 million. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group incurred capital expenditures of approximately RMB1,022.9 million, the capital expenditures were mainly related to acquisition, building construction in Dafanpu Coal Mine and other projects and the purchase of machinery and equipment. These capital expenditures were fully financed by internal resources. The Group did not conduct any exploration activities and did not incur any expense or capital expenditure in exploration activities for the year ended 31 December 2021. The breakdown of the Group’s expenses in relation to its mining activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 is summarised as follows: For the year ended 31 December 2021 Looking forward to 2022, the new variants of COVID-19 and the escalation of geopolitical conflicts will continue to disrupt the economic recovery and the pressure of inflation continues to rise. The world economy will face many challenges. According to the Global Economic Prospects report issued by the World Bank in January 2022, it is expected that the global economic growth will decrease from 5.5% in 2021 to 4.1% in 2022, and the economic growth is entering a period of significant slowdown. The Chinese government is expected to adhere to the precise prevention and control of the pandemic, firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, maintain support for the real economy, and strive to stabilize the macro-economy. In terms of coal market, it is expected that the relaxation of industrial power and real estate policies in 2022 will continue to support the demand for coal. As the effect of the coal supply guarantee policy gradually becomes apparent, the industry may show a pattern of growth in both supply and demand, and return to the balance between supply and demand from supply tension. It is expected that the coal price will drop, but the overall coal price will remain at a relatively high level. Coupled with the production expansion under the supply guarantee policy, the leading coal enterprises are expected to maintain growth. Looking forward to 2022, the Group will continue to implement the development concept of both safety and efficiency, further implement the refined operation strategy, strictly control coal quality from the source to the sales terminal, continue to optimize the diversified sales model, flexibly adjust the sales pace and strategy, and continue to improve the Group’s operating efficiency. At the same time, the Group will accelerate strategic mergers and acquisitions, seek progress while maintaining stability, grow bigger and stronger, and reward shareholders with excellent results. Other comprehensive income for the year that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Exchange differences on translation of financial statements of operations Profit for the year attributable to: Total comprehensive income for the year attributable to: Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to equity shareholders of the Company (RMB cents) Revenue of the Group increased from approximately RMB2,961.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to approximately RMB5,580.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. The increase in the Group’s revenue was mainly due to the increase in both the Group’s average selling price and sales volume of the coal products. The average selling price of the Group’s 5,000 kcal coal products increased by approximately 59.7% for the year ended 31 December 2021, and the Group’s sales volume of coal for the year ended 31 December 2021 increased by approximately 15.8% as compared with the year ended 31 December 2020. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group incurred cost of sales of approximately RMB1,976.5 million as compared to the cost of sales of approximately RMB1,679.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. The cost of sales of the Group mainly comprised salaries of coal mine workers, costs of supplementary materials, fuel and electricity, depreciation, amortisation, surcharges of mining operations and transportation costs. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recorded a gross profit of approximately RMB3,604.2 million and a gross profit margin of 64.6% which increased from the gross profit of approximately RMB1,282.2 million and the gross profit margin of 43.3% for the year ended 31 December 2020. The increase in gross profit margin for the year ended 31 December 2021 was mainly due to the combined effect of the increase in sales price and sales volume. The net amount of other incomes and losses of the Group increased from approximately RMB69.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to approximately RMB145.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. This was mainly attributable to the increase of approximately RMB82.6 million in government grants and approximately RMB10 million in donation, combined with the decrease of approximately RMB11 million in foreign exchange losses and approximately RMB3.7 million in interest income. For the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020, the Group’s net amount of other incomes and losses mainly comprised government grants, net foreign exchange differences, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, interest income and donation. Selling expenses of the Group increased from approximately RMB8.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to approximately RMB8.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, which was primarily because of the increase in marketing related expenses. The selling expenses mainly comprised salaries of sales staff and marketing related expenses. The Group’s administrative expenses increased from approximately RMB125.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to approximately RMB190.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. This was mainly attributable to the increase in staff cost during the reporting period. The administrative expenses mainly comprised salaries and related personnel expenses of the administrative, finance and human resources departments, consultancy fees and other incidental administrative expenses. The Group’s finance costs decreased from approximately RMB13.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to approximately RMB12.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. The decrease in the Group’s finance costs was mainly attributable to the settlement of long-term payables. The major components of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are: Reversal and origination of temporary differences (a) Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), the Company and its subsidiaries, Blue Gems Worldwide Limited and Porus Power Limited, are not subject to any income tax in the Cayman Islands and BVI, respectively. (b) PRC corporate income tax (“CIT”) was provided at a rate of 25% (2020: 25%) on the taxable income of the companies comprising the Group, as adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes. (c) Pursuant to the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared to foreign investors from the foreign investment enterprises established in Mainland China. The requirement is effective from 1 January 2008 and applies to earnings after 31 December 2007. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if certain criteria are met. The Group is therefore liable for withholding taxes on dividends distributed by those subsidiaries established in Mainland China in respect of earnings generated from 1 January 2008. During this year, the Group provided for and paid withholding tax subject to a tax rate of 10%. As a result of the foregoing, the Group recorded a consolidated net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company of approximately RMB2,468.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, which increased substantially from the consolidated net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company of approximately RMB814.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. Net profit margin increased from 27.5% in 2020 to 44.2% in 2021. On 28 April 2022, the Board proposed a final dividend of HKD0.065 per share, payable to the shareholders of the Company whose names appear on the register of members of the Company on 14 June 2022.

The proposal of the distribution of final dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company (the “AGM”). The Group’s net cash generated from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was approximately RMB3,030.2 million, primarily due to profit before taxation of approximately RMB3,422.3 million, adjusted for depreciation of approximately RMB91.7 million, amortization of intangible assets and right-of-use assets of approximately RMB31.4 million, an increase in trade and other receivables of RMB120.4 million, an increase in trade and other payables and contract liabilities of approximately RMB85.4 million, losses on fair value changes of financial assets of approximately RMB134.6 million, income tax paid of approximately RMB532.6 million and other items including interest expenses, interest income, share of profits of an associate, gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment, changes in inventories and restricted deposits. The Group’s net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was approximately RMB873.8 million, primarily due to payments for purchasing property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets of approximately RMB180.7 million, the increase and decrease in time deposits of approximately RMB1,481.7 million and prepayment for the proposed acquisitions of RMB885.7 million. The Group’s net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was approximately RMB641.0 million, which was primarily due to dividend payment of approximately RMB661.5 million and the net increase in the Group’s bank loans of approximately RMB70.7 million. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s cash at bank was approximately RMB2,387.2 million, as compared with approximately RMB877.7 million at 31 December 2020, mainly attributable to an increase in the cash at bank by approximately RMB1,515.4 million and the exchange loss of approximately RMB5.9 million. The table below sets out the Group’s current assets, current liabilities and net current assets as at 31 December As at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the net current assets of the Group amounted to approximately RMB1,827.7 million and RMB853.4 million, respectively. In light of our current liquidity position and our projected cash inflows generated from operations, the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient working capital for our present requirements and for the next 12 months. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group’s cash at bank were mainly used for the development of the Group’s Dafanpu Coal Mine and other potential projects, as well as repaying the debts of the Group and funding the Group’s working capital. The Group financed its funding requirements mainly through a combination of interest- bearing bank loans and cash generated from operating activities. The Group’s gearing ratio decreased from -31.9% as at 31 December 2020 to -85.8% as at 31 December 2021. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by capital plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash at bank. Capital is equivalent to the total equity. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s cash at bank, amounting to approximately RMB2,387.2 million, were denominated in RMB (99.6%) and Hong Kong dollars (0.4%). As at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group’s bank loans were repayable within 1 year or on demand. The Group’s secured bank loans were as follows: As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s bank loans amounting to RMB275,695,000 are secured by the Group’s pledged deposits amounting to RMB96,493,000 (As at 31 December 2020, the Group’s bank loans amounting to RMB210,410,000 are secured by the Group’s pledged deposits amounting to RMB52,603,000). As at 31 December 2021, Mr. Zhang Li and Mr. Zhang Liang, Johnson have guaranteed the Group’s bank loans amounting to RMB275,695,000 (31 December 2020: RMB210,410,000). (a) The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from the bank loan with a floating interest rate. The bank loan with a floating interest rate exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and borrowings issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group did not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group did not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its debt obligations. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would affect profit or loss. The Board will continue to closely monitor the Group’s loan portfolio in order to manage the Group’s interest rate risk exposure. (b) The Company and its subsidiaries comprising the Group are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk since their transactions and balances are principally denominated in their respective functional currencies. The Group did not enter into any financial instruments to hedge against foreign currency risk for the year ended 31 December 2021. (c) Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Group utilises cash flow forecast and other relevant information to monitor its liquidity requirements and to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash to support its business and operational activities. The Group incurred capital expenditures of approximately RMB1,022.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, which were mainly related to acquisition, construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment of the Dafanpu Coal Mine and other projects. These capital expenditures were fully financed by internal resources. Off-balance Sheet Arrangement The Group did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments and off-balance sheet guarantees for outstanding loans. The Group did not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. The Group’s capital commitments as at 31 December 2021 amounted to approximately RMB644.8 million which were mainly related to acquisition, construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment of the Dafanpu Coal Mine and other projects. According to the Group’s production plan in the coming few years, the underground extraction activities will expand into corresponding agricultural land area currently occupied by various domestic households.

(2.1) DS – accounted for 41.6% of the Group’s revenue in FY 2021 (23.5) DS is a type of high alloy special steel manufactured using rare metals including molybdenum, chromium and vanadium. DS is mainly used in die and mould casting as well as machining processing. Many different manufacturing industries require moulds, including automotive, high-speed railway construction, aviation and plastic product manufacturing industries. Driven by the increased vaccination rates in 2021, global economy rebounded significantly, especially in high-income and mid-income countries. China’s exports were stimulated by rapid recovery of the manufacturing industries in Europe and North America. These contributed to the increased overseas demand for DS. As a result, the Group’s export revenue increased by 54.5% to RMB1,175,538,000 (2020: RMB760,961,000). While China’s manufacturing industries having maintained steady growth, the Group has made a strategic move during the reporting period and concentrated its production capacity to meet the rapidly growing export demand. Domestic revenue recorded a decrease of 23.5% to RMB1,216,376,000 (2020: RMB1,590,257,000). Overall, sales of the DS segment remained relatively stable at RMB2,391,914,000 (2020: RMB2,351,218,000). HSS – accounted for 17.5% of the Group’s revenue in FY 2021 HSS, manufactured using rare metals including tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium and cobalt, is characterised by greater hardness, heat resistance and durability. These attributes make HSS suitable to such applications as cutting tools and in the manufacture of high-temperature bearings, high-temperature springs, internal- combustion engines and rolls, with wide usage in specific industrial applications such as automotive, machinery manufacturing, aviation, and electronics industries. As mentioned before, most factories in Europe and North America resumed operations gradually after the extensive rollout of vaccination programs. As an important material for various manufacturing industries, overseas demand for HSS increased in 2021. HSS export revenue increased significantly by 81.2% to RMB435,075,000 in 2021 (2020: RMB240,162,000). Domestic demand for HSS maintained a steady growth and revenue from the domestic market increased by 6.5% to RMB570,361,000 (2020: RMB535,339,000). Overall revenue of HSS in 2021 increased by 29.6% to RMB1,005,436,000 (2020: RMB775,501,000). Cutting tools – accounted for 18.4% of the Group’s revenue in FY 2021 Cutting tools segment includes HSS and carbide cutting tools. HSS cutting tools products can be categorised into four major types – twist drill bits, screw taps, end mills and turning tools. All of these are used in industrial manufacturing. The two main types of HSS cutting tools manufactured by the Group are twist drill bits and screw taps. The Group’s vertical integration extending from upstream HSS production to downstream HSS cutting tools production brought us a significant cost advantage over our peers. High-end carbide tools manufactured by the Group mainly comprised of customised carbide tools. With the recovery of global manufacturing industries, growth was recorded in both domestic and export revenue of cutting tools. In addition to the recovery of overseas manufacturing industries, DIY demand on cutting tools in North America remained strong in 2021. Driven by demand from both civil and industrial sectors, export revenue increased by 24.9% to RMB772,564,000 (2020: RMB618,529,000). In domestic market, demand mainly was driven by the industrial sector. Increased usage of computer numerical control (“CNC”) machine tools in various production process boosted the demand of high-end cutting tools. Domestic revenue increased by 11.2% to RMB285,420,000 (2020: RMB256,637,000). Titanium alloy – accounted for 4.6% of the Group’s revenue in FY 2021 The corrosion resistance nature of titanium alloy promoted the extensive applications of titanium alloy in various industries, including aerospace, chemical pipeline equipment, nuclear and ocean industries. In 2021, demand for titanium alloy from downstream enterprises has gradually improved after sustained recovery of the domestic economy. Sales volume increased by 50.5% while average selling price increased by 2.6%. Overall revenue, therefore, increased by 54.4% to RMB263,146,000 (2020: RMB170,474,000). The domestic titanium industry underwent structural adjustment in 2020. Titanium application development towards high-end consumption, including aerospace, marine engineering, high-end chemical industry and sports and leisure, had achieved strong results. The Group’s titanium alloy products have obtained the Quality Management System for Aerospace Certification issued by Bureau Veritas, an international authoritative quality certification body. Titanium alloys have also been listed as key strategic materials whose application is expected to be vigorously promoted. The Group is confident that by devoting into the research and development of titanium application, acceptance of the Group’s products will be further enhanced. The Group is also focused on transformation and upgrading of titanium products from billets to finished products. This segment involved the trading of general carbon steel products outside of the Group’s production scope. As the Group continued to focus on its principal and core businesses in 2021, the business volume of commodity trading continued to decrease. Net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company increased by 23.7% from RMB537,024,000 in 2020 to RMB664,371,000 in 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) increased gross profit margin of the Group’s products; (ii) increased government grants received for encouraging technological innovation and rewarding contributions to the local economy and (iii) partially offset by increased distribution expenses as a result of increased sales to overseas markets. Revenue of the Group for 2021 totalled RMB5,744,873,000, representing an increase of 10.0% when compared with RMB5,220,944,000 in 2020. The increase was mainly caused by the increase in revenue from HSS, cutting tools and titanium alloy segments, ranging from 20.9% to 54.4%. DS segment remained stable. The total revenue from the four major production segments increased by 13.1% to RMB4,718,480,000 (2020: RMB4,172,359,000). For the analysis of individual segments, please refer to the “Business Review” section. The Group’s cost of sales was RMB4,339,675,000 in 2021, representing an increase of 8.3% as compared with RMB4,006,964,000 in 2020, as a result of the increase in revenue. In 2021, the overall gross margin was 24.5% (2020: 23.3%). Set out below are the gross margin of the five segments of the Group in 2021 and 2020: In May 2021, the export VAT rebate on DS has been cancelled, thereby reducing the gross margin of DS. As a result, the gross margin of DS decreased from 28.1% in 2020 to 26.6% in 2021. The gross margin of HSS increased from 28.1% in 2020 to 32.5% in 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of high-end products and powder metallurgy products with higher gross margin. The gross margin of cutting tools increased from 18.9% in 2020 to 28.4% in 2021. The increase was mainly due to the combined effect of: (i) an increase in production quantity which resulted in a lower average fixed cost per unit; and (ii) increased proportion of high-end tap and milling cutter products which contributed to a higher gross margin. The gross margin of titanium alloy segment decreased from 18.2% in 2020 to 16.0% in 2021. As the price of sponge titanium rose in a short period of time, which in turn extruded the gross margin of titanium alloy. The gross margin of this segment decreased from 0.04% in 2020 to 0.03% in 2021. Other income increased from RMB70,429,000 in 2020 to RMB129,387,000 in 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in government grants received for encouraging technological innovation and rewarding contributions to the local economy and a net realised and unrealised gains on other financial assets. Distribution expenses in 2021 was RMB217,737,000 (2020: RMB87,489,000). Notwithstanding the resumption of export sales to Europe and North America after the recovery of manufacturing industries, freight and related logistics expenses increased compared to 2020. Tight supply of overseas freight services during the year added further burden to the distribution cost. In 2021, distribution expenses amounted to approximately 3.8% of revenue (2020: 1.7%). Administrative expenses increased from RMB105,963,000 in 2020 to RMB134,575,000 in 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) local government exempted social insurance contribution during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 which was not available in 2021; (ii) organisation of 40th anniversary ceremony event; and (iii) increased sewage charges for complying with new environmental policy. In 2021, administrative expenses amounted to approximately 2.3% of revenue (2020: 2.0%). Other expenses increased from RMB35,424,000 in 2020 to RMB47,274,000 in 2021. During the year, RMB appreciated against USD, EUR and HKD. Offsetting the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group had a net assets position in USD, EUR and HKD. As a result, the Group recognised a net foreign exchange losses of RMB36,075,000 in 2021. Additional impairment provision of RMB5,318,000 was provided according to the credit loss estimation policy of the Group. Further to the above, additional charitable donations of RMB2,610,000 were made in 2021. Most of these charitable donations related to assistance against the COVID-19. In 2021, the Group incurred lower interest expenses with the decrease in average loan balance and lower interest cost. However, as compared to 2020, additional interest expenses were incurred on other financial liability related to the equity interest in TG Tools invested by certain third party investors. Therefore, the Group’s net finance costs increased by 3.3% to RMB131,484,000 (2020: RMB127,309,000). As set out in Note 8 of the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the Group’s income tax expense decreased by 1.8% from RMB81,495,000 in 2020 to RMB80,025,000 in 2021. It was mainly due to the additional tax deduction for research and development expenses in 2021. As a result of the factors set out above, the Group’s share of profit increased by 23.7% from RMB537,024,000 in 2020 to RMB664,371,000 in 2021. The margin of profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company increased from 10.3% in 2020 to 11.6% in 2021. In 2021, total comprehensive income for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company was RMB676,701,000 (2020: RMB538,979,000) after taking into account foreign currency translation differences and fair value adjustments on equity investments. During the year, the Group credited to other comprehensive income a foreign currency translation difference of RMB12,086,000 (2020: debited RMB6,795,000) related to translation of financial statements of Hong Kong subsidiaries and overseas equity accounted investees. The Group also recognised a fair value gain in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of RMB24,430,000 (2020: loss of RMB4,840,000) on its equity investments. Other financial assets held by the Group included equity interests in Bank of Jiangsu Co., Ltd., (Xiamen Chuangfeng Yizhi Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership)*), Nanjing Xiaomuma Technology Co., Ltd., JM Digital Steel Inc., (Ningbo Meishan Free Trade Port Qian Equity Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership)*), (CICC Jiatai Private Equity Fund III (Shenzhen) Partnership (Limited Partnership)*) and Ji’nan Financial Fosun Weishi Equity Investment Fund Partnership (Limited Partnership). All of these investments were stated at their fair value as at 31 December 2021. Other than the fair value gain, net of tax, of RMB24,430,000 (2020: loss of RMB4,840,000) recorded in the other comprehensive income in 2021, the fair value gain of RMB11,502,000 was recorded in other income (2020: loss of RMB1,892,000 recorded in other expenses) for financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss during the year. Trade and bills receivables decreased from RMB2,017,167,000 in 2020 to RMB1,883,334,000 in 2021, which was mainly due to persevering credit control over the receivables. During the year, loss allowance of trade and bills receivables decreased by RMB2,347,000. On average, the proportion of short-aged trade and bills receivable was higher compared to 2020. Marked as the beginning of the “14th Five-Year” Plan, the economic performance in 2021 was satisfactory with total economic volume exceeding RMB110 trillion. During the year, despite the impacts of unfavourable factors such as the pandemic and the flood, and under the pressure of affected supply and demand, China demonstrated strong resilience and made a good start. The Chinese government has maintained regular pandemic prevention and control measures and targeted pandemic prevention and control measures to ensure a stable socio-economic development space and environment. In particular, supported by the government, the industrial production successfully dealt with a number of unfavourable factors with a continued momentum in overall recovery. In 2021, the added value of industries above designated size increased by 9.6% year-on-year. The utilisation rate of industrial production capacity reached 77.5% while the delivery value for export of industries above designated size increased by 17.7% year-on-year. In terms of overseas markets, the economies reopened as many countries gradually relaxed their pandemic prevention measures such as lockdown, which released the pent-up demand for steel. Coupled with impacts of the surging international steel price and other factors, China’s export of steel rebounded in 2021 after five consecutive years of decline. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, annual exports of steel totalled 66.90 million tons, representing a year-on-year increase 24.6%. In general, under the promotion of industry transformation and the security and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain by China, the overall steel industry performed well in 2021, and the efficiency of the steel industry achieved historical success. The accumulated operating income of key large and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises in the year was RMB6.93 trillion, an increase of 32.7% year-on-year; the total accumulated profit was RMB 352.4 billion, increased by 59.7% year-on-year, hitting a record high; the sales profit margin reached 5.08%, a rise of 0.85 percentage points as compared to 2020. Looking back at the DS market in 2021, against the backdrop of the low-carbon emission in China, the market demand in the second half of 2021 was lower than expected, automobile production declined and home appliances and other manufacturing industries were relatively weak, thus the demand for DS was mediocre. However, for the overseas markets, gradual opening of Europe and the United States and other economies stimulated the demand for DS. Cutting tools are the main application market for HSS and some alloy steel. In recent years, the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry and the improvement of mechanical properties of processing materials have led to the increasing usage and proportion of advanced cutting materials, such as high-performance HSS and carbide. In addition, more and more downstream enterprises in China have used CNC machines for production, and the corresponding increase in consumer demand for high-end cutting tools has driven the demand for high- end HSS. This has led to a continuous increase in the scale of the domestic cutting tool market. With the higher reliability requirements of high efficiency cutting and CNC tools from the market and the development of metallurgical technology, alloy HSS and ordinary HSS in the low-end market will be gradually eliminated, and high-performance HSS will see a broader development opportunity. According to the “The Economic Operation of the Machine Tool Industry in 2021” issued by the China Machine Tool & Tool Builders’ Association, China’s export of cutting tools increased by 34.9% to USD3.83 billion year-on-year, while export of metal-cutting machine tools increased by 32.7 % in 2021. In terms of policy, China has introduced a series of policies to support the development of the special steel industry since 2015, including the inclusion of special steel products in the catalogue of new materials in the 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of New Materials Industry, and the inclusion of HSS and DS in Made-in-China 2025 Plan, which focuses on the development of advanced basic materials. China has actively promoted the supply-side structural reform of the iron and steel industry, and achieved remarkable results in dealing with excess capacity, rationalizing the industrial structure. Green development, intelligent manufacturing and international cooperation have also made a progress, providing strong support for a healthy development of the society and economy. At the beginning of the “14th Five-Year” Plan, China continued to focus on solving the great pressure of excess capacity, enhancing the green and low-carbon development level and other issues in order to boost a higher quality development of the industry. According to the world ranking of HSS and DS (collectively known as alloy tool steel) released by the world’s authoritative SMR Steel and Metal Market Research, the Group ranked first in the world in terms of alloy tool steel products output in 2020. Moreover, HSS of TG Tools qualified for the Manufacturing Individual Champion Product Award in 2021 review. As a well-known manufacturer of advanced basic materials such as HSS and DS, key strategic materials such as titanium alloy and precision cutting tools, which is a key development focus of China, the Group will further accelerate its transformation and upgrading strategy in 2021, ushering in the key strategic development period with the largest investment in high-tech projects since its establishment. The 50,000-ton high alloy tool steel new material technology transformation and enhancement project has been completed by the end of 2021. The heavy-duty (7,000 tons) fast forging production line project, the second phase of powder metallurgy project, the second phase of Thailand project, intelligent powder metallurgy tap project and carbide cutting tool project are all under orderly planning and implementation. In order to meet the needs of business development and maintain capital flexibility, the Group conducted a share placement of 200 million shares in May 2021 in a top-up placement, of which approximately half of the net proceeds of about HKD834 million will be used to expand the Group’s industrial park in Thailand and develop new precision tools products, while the remaining net proceeds are intended as general working capital. The Group’s plant in the Rojana Rayong Pluak Daeng Industrial Park, Rayong, Thailand, was completed in September 2020 and commenced mass production in the first quarter of 2021. It is the Group’s first highly automated overseas factory for cutting tools, with a current annual production capacity of 48 million pieces. The factory adopted fully automatic production lines, which enables it to achieve higher production efficiency and flexible expansion. The design capacity of 4 million pieces per month was fully achieved during the year. As for new precision tools, the Group is committed to the research and development of carbide and powder metallurgy taps. Currently, China’s carbide products are of middle and low-grade and difficult to meet the needs of the domestic high-end manufacturing industry. Therefore, high-end carbide CNC blades and other high-tech, high value-added carbide products have to be imported from abroad, while the application and demand for powder metallurgy taps continue to increase because of its excellent performance. The Group’s research and development of carbide and powder metallurgy taps will bring enormous benefits to the Group and the special new materials industry in China. In April 2021, TG Tools formally kicked-off the A-share spin-off listing plan, marking a significant milestone for the Group in the capital market. TG Tools, together with its subsidiaries, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of alloy tool steels, whose production processes include conventional metallurgy and powder metallurgy. The Group has led the industry with its professional equipment, technology and management advantages, focusing on research and development and cost control for many years, in order to meet the domestic market demand as well as gain international market share. Precise strategic layout, efficient execution ability and world-leading technology are the three core pillars of the Group. Looking back at the past year, the Group continued to implement the development strategy of high-quality transformation, continuously overcame the difficulties of smelting technology through industry-leading research and development capabilities, and strived to optimize the production process and product structure. With excellent products, the Group promoted the direct sales strategy to deeply bind high-quality customers. In addition, by virtue of its leading industry position and pioneering advantages in China, the Group will actively extend the industrial supply chain and increase the added value of products to manifest their true value. Currently, China is still in a stable period of economic recovery after the pandemic. Enterprises are pursuing cost reduction and efficiency enhancement and are actively improving production efficiency to match the national pace. Among them, the steel and special new materials industry continued to record a simultaneous increase in production capacity and output, triggering a rapid rise in commodity prices. Since the beginning of the year, prices of the Group’s alloy tool steel products have also risen consecutively due to the rising prices of raw materials such as scrap steel and rare metals. China will continue to promote the development of steel industry during the “14th Five-Year” plan. In February 2022, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Ecology and Environment published Guiding Opinions on Promoting the High-Equality Development of Steel Industry, which proposed that by 2025, we should strive to achieve basic high-quality development model of the steel industry, which has a reasonable layout structure, stable supply of resources, advanced technology and equipment, outstanding quality brands, high intelligence level, strong global competitiveness and green, low-carbon and sustainable development. Meanwhile, China has clarified the “30•60 Goals” early on. The Group continues to promote the innovation transformation of products to respond to national steel industry goals and the overall national strategy of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. In order to keep pace with the market development speed, the “50,000 Tons Alloy Tool Steel Capacity Expansion Project” planned by the Group at the beginning of 2021 was completed before the end of year 2021. The project will mainly focus on high-end alloy tool steel products, including HSS and DS. After the project reaches its planned production capacity, the Group will have a production capacity of 300,000 tons of alloy tool steel. On the basis of expanding capacities, the Group will continue to strengthen its research and development of high-end alloy tool steel, so as to enhance the competitiveness of the Group’s products. As a pioneer in the industry, the Group will continue to be a dominant player in the field of alloy tool steel. As the cornerstone of the manufacturing industry, the Group will take tackling the “bottleneck” technology at the material end as its core task, actively making efforts to ensure the national security need of key special steel material and thriving to achieve key technology breakthroughs and sci-tech self-reliance and self-strengthening at higher levels. Under the prospect that America’s inflation growth will continue to rise, Federal Reserve may raise interest rates several times in 2022. The tightening monetary policy stance puts pressure on RMB to depreciate, while exports are likely to be stimulated to increase. Other major overseas steel producing countries, including India and Japan, are facing volatile pandemic situations, which has affected the supply side to a certain extent, thus maybe benefiting China’s steel exports. Meanwhile, various countries and regions including Europe and America had successively adopted the stance of “co-existing with the virus” and opened borders, resulting in a rebound of economy and demand, which also benefits China’s exports. Being adherent to promoting the globalization strategy, the current overseas layout of the Group is rather diversified, with approximately ten sales office established overseas. During the record year, plants in Rojana Rayong Pluak Daeng Industrial Park, Rayong, Thailand officially commenced its trial production in the first quarter of 2021, becoming an important starting point of overseas expansion. The plant’s current production capacity for the first phase is 48 million pieces of cutting tools, while the second phase of the project is expected to finish by the end of 2022, adding 48 million pieces of production capacity, which makes a total of nearly 100 million pieces of production capacity. The Group hopes to continue optimizing and consolidating the current overseas layout in response to the recovery of overseas demand and global uncertain elements. In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of the automobile, machinery manufacturing, metal industry, aerospace, instrumentation, hardware tools, engineering machinery, electronic household appliances and high-tech industries, the capacity of powder metallurgy has been expanding, and development opportunities are enormous. The growth of China’s powder metallurgy industry is also related to the development and application of new products, new materials, new processes and new equipment, as well as the continuous improvement and innovation of existing products and production processes. In March 2018, the Group began to plan and prepare its first industrialised powder metallurgy production line in China. The production line with an annual capacity of 2,000 tons was officially completed and put into operation in November 2019, making the successful first step into the powder metallurgy industry. The Group began to gradually expand powder metallurgy production in 2021. Contract orders have increased significantly since then, and powder metallurgy has become a growth driver for the Group. The Group’s distribution of powder metallurgy with a leading supplier of special steel products in Europe, which is also a business partner, has also achieved fruitful results. The Group will continue to deepen the transformation of high-end products and make unremitting efforts to invest in the research and development of powder metallurgy. It is expected that the second phase of the powder metallurgy production line will be completed in 2022 as planned, with an additional annual production capacity of 3,000 tons. The total production capacity is expected to further increase to 5,000 tons. At the same time, with the increasing market demand for efficient cutting and CNC tools, it is expected that the proportion of powder metallurgy applications will further increase significantly. The Group is intensively promoting the manufacturing of powder metallurgy HSS cutting tools, including powder metallurgy taps and drill bits. It is expected to achieve import substitution and greatly improve the machine tool processing capacity of China’s manufacturing industry. Cutting tools are the foundation of the machinery manufacturing industry and major technical fields. The quality of cutting tools directly determines the production level of the machinery manufacturing industry and is one of the most important factors for the manufacturing industry to improve production efficiency and product quality. In recent years, the Group has actively sought to upgrade its products and focused on the high-end carbide cutting tools market, providing cutting tools with higher alloy content and higher added value to seize the opportunities brought by the continuous growth of demand for high-end carbide cutting tools in China. Currently, the Group has formed a subsidiary with certain industry experts for the production of carbide, and has started to participate in the carbide cutting tools market from the raw material end. Titanium wire made of titanium can be used in downstream scenarios such as eyeglass frames, 3D printing and 3C products. The Group will continue to explore the market for titanium wire by coordinating downstream customers to identify projects that can help them with better application. The Group hopes to move forward to the application scenarios of refined titanium alloys through more R&D application projects, open up downstream markets, and promote higher-quality development. The Group has been investing significant resources to expand its online sales channels. The Group’s products are sold on a number of major e-commerce platforms around the world, including Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, JD.com and Tmall, which further drives the sales of cutting tools. During the pandemic, the e-commerce platforms sales have proved their significance. The Group has also been cooperating with downstream heat treatment and cutting suppliers to improve its understanding of customer needs. In order to cope with the Group’s expansion of production capacity, international development, expansion of product lines, more precise and professional production processes and more diversified sales channels, the Group has invested heavily in building a digital information system, “Digital Tiangong”, which covers all business areas of the Group. The system completes the digital development of five areas: from sales to payment collection, purchases to payments, planning to resources, manufacturing to costs, and orders to deliveries. This system effectively improves the performance of network procurement, comprehensively enhances the synergy of the industrial supply chain, greatly enhances the competitiveness of the Group, and makes the best preparation for the transformation of the Group to an amoeba management model. In 2022, the Group’s information engineering will focus on the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) by collecting more process and production data from factories, with a view to maintaining more accurate production information through the system, so as to better control costs. After 14 months of successful completion of the first phase of the “Digital Tiangong” project, the second phase of the smart manufacturing project was officially launched in June 2021, which involved a wider range of departments and functions. The Group hopes to accelerate its plans in line with the strategic deployment of the construction of digital China by implementing comprehensive transformation and upgrade, and to lead the change and development of the industry. The Group will accelerate its digitalisation and smart development by gradually implementing informatization, in order to achieve comprehensive management, research and development, as well as overall production technology transformation and upgrades, and to lead the change and development of the industry. The Group has always strived for innovation and advancements in competitiveness to consolidate its leading market position. The Group re-affirms its mission to maximise shareholder value, uphold high corporate governance standards and lead the industry to move forward. This management discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Group. These forward looking statements represent the Company’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Readers including shareholders and investors should be cautioned that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated or implied in any forward looking statement. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s current assets included cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,356,881,000, inventories of RMB2,277,610,000, trade and other receivables of RMB2,131,259,000, pledged deposits of RMB244,191,000 and time deposits of RMB1,749,481,000. As at 31 December 2021, the interest-bearing borrowings of the Group were RMB2,638,786,000 (2020: RMB3,365,819,000), RMB1,600,786,000 of which was repayable within one year and RMB1,038,000,000 of which was repayable after more than one year. The Group’s adjusted net debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated based on adjusted net debt (defined as total interest-bearing borrowings plus unaccrued proposed dividends, less time deposits and cash and cash equivalents) divided by adjusted capital (comprising all components of equity, less unaccrued proposed dividends) as at 31 December 2021, was 0.0% (2020: 43.6%). After the placings of shares by TG Tools, part of the funds raised were used to repay the bank borrowings. As at 31 December 2021, borrowings of RMB1,757,700,000 were in RMB, USD65,487,367 were in USD, EUR61,942,110 were in EUR and HKD20,000,000 were in HKD. The borrowings of the Group were subject to interest payable at rates ranging from 0.76% to 4.75% per annum. There is no seasonality in borrowing requirements of the Group. The Group did not enter into any financial instruments to hedge itself against risks associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. During the year, net cash generated from operating activities was RMB542,300,000 (2020: RMB1,307,414,000). The decrease was mainly attributable to: (i) ramp-up of inventories in anticipation of an imminent increase in demand in the first half of 2022; and (ii) settlement of trade and other payables made to suppliers near the year end. The cash conversion cycle, calculated as turnover days over inventory, plus turnover days over trade receivables, minus turnover days of trade payables, attempts to measure the amount of time each net input dollar is tied up in the production and sales process before it is converted into cash through sales to customers. It is important to manufacturers because it measures the efficiency of their capital chain management. The Group’s turnover days of inventory for 2021 was 167 days (2020: 156 days). The increase in turnover days of inventory was mainly due to the stock up in preparation for expected sales growth in the first half in 2022 and the increasing cost of materials which boosted the average cost of inventories balance. The Group maintained an effective and efficient balance between the stock levels and sales forecasts. The Group’s turnover days of trade receivables for 2021 was 124 days (2020: 146 days) while the turnover days of trade payables for 2021 was 110 days (2020: 127 days). Accordingly, the Group’s cash conversion cycle for 2021 was 181 days (2020: 175 days). The turnover days figures of the Group were quite stable, reflecting tight control over the purchase, production and sales operations by the management. The management will continue to monitor closely the operations in view of the changing business environment. It should be noted that the calculation of the aforesaid indexes may not be consistent with those measurement indexes published by other issuers. For 2021, the Group’s net increase in property, plant and equipment amounted to RMB136,820,000, which was mainly due to expenditure on production line of powder metallurgy and was financed by a combination of our internal cash resources, operating cashflows and bank borrowings. As at 31 December 2021, capital commitments were RMB1,022,087,000 (2020: RMB544,430,000), of which RMB138,169,000 (2020: RMB69,910,000) were contracted for and RMB883,918,000 (2020: RMB474,520,000) were authorised but not contracted for. The majority of the capital commitments related to the construction of heavy-duty (7,000 tons) fast forging machine production line and powder metallurgy tap production line, second phase of powder metallurgy project, the second phase of Thailand factory and carbide cutting tools project and will be funded by internal resources and operating cash flows of the Group. The Group placed an aggregate of 200,000,000 ordinary shares of par value of USD0.0025 each and representing 7.16% of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company at the placing price of HKD4.22 per share to not less than six placees (the “Placing”). The aggregate nominal value of the placing shares under the Placing was USD500,000. The placing of the 200,000,000 shares was completed on 7 May 2021 with the net proceeds of approximately HKD834 million representing a net issue price of approximately HKD4.215 per share. The market price of the placing share was HKD4.88 per share as quoted on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) on 4 May 2021, the last full trading day immediately before the time at which the Placing and Subscription Agreement was signed. The Directors considered that the Placing represented an opportunity to raise capital for the Company, broaden its shareholder base, increase the liquidity of the shares, strengthen the capital base and to enhance the financial position and net assets base for the long-term development and growth of the Group. The Directors believe that with the accelerated pace of transformation and upgrading of the PRC’s manufacturing industry, as well as the rising standard of intelligent manufacturing and digital control equipment, high-end precision cutting tools has a promising prospect with a strong demand from the manufacturing industry. With the technological breakthroughs in cutting tools materials and the advantages of local technical guidance and after-sales service, the substitution of imported high-end precision cutting tools by the domestic ones has been gradually taking place. The Directors hope to use the opportunity of the Placing to advance the deployment of the Group’s new products and production capabilities in the high-end precision cutting tools industry, so as to meet the growing demand in the future. The proceeds from the Placing have been used as follows: Actual use of proceeds (as at 31 December 2021) Proposed use of the remaining unutilised proceeds (as at 31 December 2021) (i) Expansion of the industrial HK$19.9 million was used in the expansion of the industrial park of The remaining unutilised (ii) Development of the new precision tools products of HK$17.7 million was used in development of the new precision The remaining unutilised (iii) Replenishment of Group’s working capital to procure raw materials and meet any cashflow requirements that may arise from daily HK$415.3 million was used as working capital and for daily operation, including payment of electricity, staff salaries and The remaining unutilised The unutilised proceeds are expected to be fully utilised by 31 December 2022. The Group’s revenues were denominated in RMB, USD and EUR, with RMB accounting for the largest portion of 58.5%. 41.5% of total sales and operating profit were subject to exchange rate fluctuations. The Group has put in place measures such as monthly review of product pricing in the light of foreign exchange fluctuations and incentivising overseas customers to settle balances on a more timely basis to minimise the financial impact of exchange rate exposures. As at 31 December 2021, the Group pledged certain bank deposits amounting to RMB244,191,000 (2020: RMB384,700,000) and certain trade receivables amounting to RMB175,195,000 (2020: RMB160,835,000). The decrease in pledged bank deposits was mainly due to the decrease in the outstanding balance of bank acceptance bills. There were no material acquisitions or disposals of subsidiaries and associates of the Group during the reporting period. As at 31 December 2021, the Group employed 3,108 employees (2020: 3,008 employees). Total staff costs for the year amounted to RMB360,069,000 (2020: RMB267,114,000). The increase was mainly resulted from the increase in production output and cancellation of social insurance COVID-19 exemption policy by the local government. The Group provided employees with remuneration packages comparable to market rates and employees are further rewarded based on their performance according to the framework of the Group’s salaries, incentives and bonuses scheme. In order to enhance the Group’s productivity, and further improve the quality of the Group’s human resources, the Group provides compulsory continuous training for all of its staff on a regular basis. Neither the Group, nor the Company, had any significant contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period. The main activities of the Group include production and sales of DS, HSS, cutting tools and titanium alloy. The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. In order to minimise the credit risk in relation to trade receivables, the Directors have delegated a team responsible for the determination of credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that appropriate follow-up actions are taken to recover overdue debts. The Group has also purchased insurances relating to trade receivables. In addition, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of each reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. Therefore, the Directors consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. Details of the above main risks and measures for risk reduction are set out in note 35 to the financial statements. Apart from the financial risks mentioned above, the Group is exposed to certain operating risks and uncertainties including rare metal price volatility and market demand. Rare metals represented a significant portion in the cost of materials of the Group’s products. The price of rare metals significantly affected the per unit production costs of the Group’s products. In view of the risk of rare metal price volatility, the Group has already engaged with rare metal suppliers to obtain discounted prices for purchasing rare metals over a fixed period of time. Moreover, since the price of rare metal is publicly available market information, the Group was capable to partially transmit the effect of rare metal price volatility to downstream customers. However, because of the transparency of the rare metal prices, in extreme situations where the rare metal price remained low, the Group could be under pressure to make downward pricing adjustments on our products. The Group’s business and profitability growth were affected by the uncertainties of global macroeconomic situations, which could materially affect the manufacturing industry. These uncertainties would eventually affect the demand of the Group’s products. To minimise the effect of global macroeconomic uncertainties, the Group continued to develop new markets all over the world. The Group believes that the best way to manage such risks and uncertainties is to avoid reliance on demand from a particular economy.

Also, various PRC government authorities, particularly the State Environmental Protection Administration, have the authority to issue and implement regulations governing various aspects of special steel production. The Group will constantly update and ensure compliance with new rules and regulations issued by these regulators. As at 31 December 2021 and up to the date of this report, the Board was unaware of any non-compliance with the relevant laws and regulations that had a significant impact on the Group. (i) The Group recognises human resources as assets important to the Group’s development and growth. Most of the Group’s employees were working at the manufacturing plant in Zhenjiang City, the PRC. The Group provided employees with remuneration packages comparable to the market rates and employees were further rewarded based on their performance according to the framework of the Group’s salaries, incentives and bonuses scheme. In order to enhance the Group’s productivity, and further improve the quality of the Group’s human resources, the Group provided compulsory continuous training for all of its staff on a regular basis.

The Geographical Location of Medical Institutions Consolidated into the Group as of 31 December 2021 Grade III Grade II Others (note) Note: Including Grade I hospitals, community service centers and other non-rated medical institutions. In terms of operation, in the post-pandemic era, the number of beds and the overall operation of our medical institutions have shown a recovery growth. Meanwhile, with the implementation of group management and control of hospitals, the core capabilities of disciplines, operations and services have been gradually improved to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth trends in the medical business. In 2020, due to the impact of the pandemic, the development of the medical service industry showed an abnormal trend. The overall medical business operation of our hospital group in 2020 declined slightly compared with that in 2019. Therefore, to present a more meaningful operation results, we set out below the recovery development compared with that in Revenue from medical business recovered and exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and income per In 2021, we overcame the impact of the pandemic, actively developed surgical and consumer medical businesses, and increased technical projects to further optimize the business structure.

In terms of vertical management of specialties, in 2021, we successively advanced the vertical management mode for the stomatology department/stomatology branch in 10 affiliated hospitals, with a revenue of RMB51.38 million, representing an increase of 43.4% as compared with that of 2020, and for the kidney diseases in eight affiliated hospitals (including five nephrology departments and eight hemodialysis centers), with a revenue of RMB152.51 million, representing an increase of 18.3% as compared with that of 2020. As a pilot for vertical management of tumors, Ansteel General Hospital established the first tumor precision diagnosis and treatment center within the Group in September 2021, carried out four clinical trials of tumor drugs and one clinical trial of devices, which are in compliance with GCP, and applied for 1 key research and development project in Liaoning Province. It held the Group’s first oncology annual academic meeting with a cumulative online audience of 11,700 people in December 2021. In terms of scientific research and talent training, we strengthened cooperation between university and enterprise, and signed a formal cooperation agreement with Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine. Xi’an XD Group Hospital ( ) was listed as the “Third Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine” (directly affiliated). We signed strategic cooperation agreements with the Medicine College of Hebei University of Engineering, Xi’an Medical University, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Chinese Hospital Association and other institutions. The China Clinical Research Community ( ), which we participated in initiation, also reached cooperation intention with Hainan Real World Data Research Institute ( ). Throughout the year, medical institutions published a total of 150 papers, and were granted with 39 patents, including one invention patent. 14 new subjects were approved and 29 projects were in research. We possess four registered clinical trial institutions, and over 60 registered majors in medicine and medical devices. We participated in 24 new drug projects of internationally renowned pharmaceutical companies and domestic innovative hospitals. The training platform of our hospital group uploaded over 700 learning materials, carried out over 100 various training projects, and held nearly 500 exams. Our internal cardiovascular training center completed internal training for eight hospitals on six majors and became the interventional diagnosis and treatment training base for cardiovascular disease of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association ( ). 1.2 The Expansion of the Industrial Chain Achieved Initial Results, and the Advantages of Scalable Development were Gradually In 2021, focusing on the core resources of the hospital group, we consolidated the business foundation in various fields such as Internet-based healthcare, equipment maintenance, and medical testing. While efficiently serving the Group’s internal hospitals, we actively expanded external customers and gradually established advantages from scalable development. Internet-based healthcare: relying on bricks-and-mortar hospitals, our Internet-based healthcare platform “Universal Healthcare” gave full play to the Group’s industrial resources and industry integration capabilities to become a unified Internet portal for the healthcare group, the core carrier of the healthcare industry chain business, and provide support and assistance for the digital management of specialties. As of 31 December 2021, seven medical institutions of the hospital group obtained licenses and business permits as an Internet-based hospital. “Universal Healthcare” was officially launched for 34 internal and external medical institutions with over 3,000 online doctors and 750,000 registered users, and served over 2 million visits. It has developed an online + offline service model, and realized “a one-stop medical treatment” for patients covering the whole process. Equipment maintenance: we actively promoted an advanced business model of “managing medical equipment for a full life cycle” to provide hospitals with standardized maintenance service and comprehensive equipment operation and management services. As of 31 December 2021, our maintenance business recorded an annual revenue of RMB36.96 million, representing an increase of 194.8% as compared to 2020. Medical testing: relying on clinicians and medical teams from subordinate medical institutions, the Group has carried out medical testing business to provide more accurate and professional testing services to local medical institutions nearby. Last year, we tailored the development plan of the testing center for the subordinates Xi’an XD Group Hospital and Pangang Group General Hospital ( ), and built a specialized testing platform focusing on infection, immunization, eugenics and reproduction according to the characteristics of the region and the hospital. By increasing high-end testing items and upgrading technologies, the Group established benchmarking regional testing centers of Universal Medical to incubate new profit sources for the Company. Among them, the testing center of Xi’an XD Group Hospital recorded an annual revenue of RMB89.96 million, representing an increase of 48.3% as compared to 2020. 1.3 Finance Business Developed Steadily, with an Increase of 15.6% With years of experience in the industry, we have built efficient marketing capabilities, flexible financing capabilities, and professional risk control capabilities to provide customers in public hospitals, urban public utility and other fields with comprehensive financial solutions centered on finance leasing, as well as industry, equipment and financing consulting, department upgrade and other services, which has fully guaranteed the continuous profitability of the Company as the hospital group grows. In 2021, as the regulatory system for the finance business of central enterprises was further improved, we further enhanced operation and management capabilities on the basis of sound risk prevention and mitigation to steadily advance finance business. The Group recorded interest income of finance services of RMB4,469.0 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.3%, and the gross profit of interest margin of RMB2,640.6 million, representing a year- on-year increase of 15.6%. All business indicators of the Group maintained a good level. The average yield of interest-earning assets was 7.39%, representing a decrease of 0.46 percentage point over 2020; the average cost rate of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.83%, representing a decrease of 0.48 percentage point over 2020; the net interest spread was 3.56%, and the net interest margin was 4.05%. All of the aforesaid business indicators remained at a leading position in the industry. While our finance business continues to expand steadily, our asset quality remains at an industry-leading level. As of 31 December 2021, our net interest-earning assets reached RMB61,127.6 million, representing an increase of 11.9% from the beginning of the year; the non-performing asset ratio was 0.98%, representing a decrease of 0.02 percentage point from the end of 2020; the overdue ratio (30 days) was 0.76%, representing a decrease of 0.18 percentage point from the end of 2020; and the provision coverage ratio was 238.29%, representing an increase of 32.77 percentage points from the end of 2020. We believe that with the deepening of the aging society and the acceleration of the construction of a healthy China, China’s medical and health market will maintain a trend of rapid growth in the future. However, the industry still faces complex challenges between supply and demand. In 2022, in the trend of high-quality development of the medical industry, higher requirements on efficient operation and lean management have been put forward for survival and competition among Chinese hospitals, and the hospital management group will usher in greater development opportunities. The demand for personalized and accurate specialty diagnosis and treatment continues to increase, and specialized medical services will have the opportunity to grow on a large scale. The development of smart healthcare is accelerated; the “Internet + medical and health” is gradually standardized; and the medical and health industry is continuously transformed and upgraded in a digital manner. Equipment, medical testing, and health industries such as Internet-based healthcare and health and wellness, which will be responsible for ensuring and improving people’s livelihood in the future, will also rely more on physical hospitals to strive for sustainable development. Following the overall deployment of the “14th Five-Year Plan”, we will continue to actively carry out the mission of safeguarding life and health with quality medical care, give full play to the advantages of group-based management and control to comprehensively improve the lean management, and build a digital hospital management group. We will build core capabilities in pursuing integrated development of featured specialties such as oncology and nephrology, and extend industrial chain services around the core resources of the hospital group to make breakthroughs in the high-quality development of the entire group, and create greater returns for all Shareholders.

The following table sets forth the Group’s finance service income by industry: Change % In 2021, the gross profit of interest margin from our finance service business was RMB2,640.6 million, representing an increase of 15.6% as compared to the previous year. The increase of the gross profit of interest margin was mainly due to the increase in the size of interest-earning assets and the rise of net interest spread of finance lease business. The following table sets forth the indicators of income from finance service business of the Group: 31 December 2021 31 December 2020 Average Interest income(1)/ expense(2) Average yield(3)/ cost rate(4) Average Interest income(1)/ expense(2) Average yield(3)/ cost rate(4) Net interest margin(5) Net interest spread(6) Interest income represents the interest income from finance service business; Interest expense represents financial cost of capital for finance service business; Average yield = interest income/average balance of interest-earning assets; Average cost rate = interest expense/average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, taking into account the effect of perpetual bond; Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average balance of Net interest spread is the difference between average yield of interest-earning assets and average cost rate of interest-bearing liabilities.

In 2021, the scale of the Group’s interest-earning assets recorded a solid growth as compared to the previous year. However, due to the influence of market competition and loan interest rates transmission, the average yield of new interest-earning assets decreased as compared to the previous year, making the average yield of interest-earning assets in 2021 slightly lower than that of the previous year. In 2021, the average cost rate of interest-bearing liabilities of the Group was 3.83%, representing a decrease of 0.48 percentage point from 4.31% in the previous year. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, China implemented a relatively easy monetary policy. The newly added financing costs of the Group was on a downward trend. In 2021, as contracts of high-cost financing projects expired, the proportion of new financing with lower cost increased, which drove down the Group’s overall average cost rate of interest-bearing liabilities in 2021. Control on funding cost is one of the Group’s core advantages to carry out our finance business, and we will continue to deepen cooperation with financial institutions, actively expand financing channels, enrich financing varieties, optimize liability structure, and reasonably and effectively control financing costs on the premise of ensuring sufficient capital liquidity. The Group’s advisory services business includes industry, equipment and financing advisory services as well as clinical department upgrade advisory services. Leveraging on our expanding healthcare resources platform, and in accordance with the characteristics of hospital operation at all stages, we provided customers with valuable, flexible and diversified comprehensive services comprising finance services, equipment replacement, technology and management advice, clinical department upgrade advisory so as to improve the technical service capabilities and management efficiency of partner hospitals.

In 2021, the Group’s sales and distribution costs amounted to RMB462.0 million, representing an increase of 21.5% as compared to the previous year, mainly due to the recovery of business expansion in the post-pandemic era and the cancellation of reduction and exemption of social insurance contributions under the former pandemic outbreak, which brought the sales and distribution costs back to normal level in 2021. Administrative expenses amounted to RMB739.8 million, representing an increase of 20.5% as compared to the previous year, which was mainly due to the increase in labor costs and investment in information infrastructure upgrades.

The Group’s principal financial instruments include interest-earning assets, trade receivables, trade payables, interest-bearing bank and other borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents. The main purpose of cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing bank and other borrowings is to finance the Group’s operations while other financial assets and financial liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables are directly related to the Group’s operating activities. The Group is exposed to various types of market risks in the ordinary course of business, primarily including interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk is the risk arising from the fluctuation of financing instrument or future cash flows as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Group’s interest-bearing bank and other borrowings and interest-earning assets. A principal part of the Group’s management of interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of projected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modeling). The Group aims to mitigate the impact of prospective interest rate movements which could reduce future net interest income, while balancing the cost of such risk mitigation measure. The following table sets forth a sensitivity analysis on the Group’s profit before tax affected by a reasonably possible change in interest rate, with all other variables unchanged. The sensitivity of the profit before tax is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on profit before tax, based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at the end of each reporting period subject to repricing within the coming year. Increase/(decrease) 31 December 31 December Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange relates primarily to the financing activities of the Group. The Group conducts its business mainly in RMB, with certain financing activities denominated in USD and other currencies pegged to the USD. The Group’s currency risk mainly arises from the transactions denominated in currencies other than RMB. In order to control currency risk, the Group adopted prudent currency risk management strategies which hedges risk exposures one by one under comprehensive risk exposure management. It proactively hedged against foreign exchange exposure based on the currency and terms through using the operation of financial instruments such as forward exchange rate. As of 31 December 2021, the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk amounted to USD2,115.4 million, USD2,103.7 million or 99.4% of which had been hedged against by various financial instruments. Thus, the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is basically covered. The table below sets forth a sensitivity analysis on the Group’s profit before tax affected by a reasonably possible change in exchange rate: Increase/(decrease) Change in The exchange rate of RMB to USD is managed under a floating exchange rate system. The HKD exchange rate has been linked to the USD and therefore the exchange rate of RMB to HKD has fluctuated and will fluctuate in line with the changes in the exchange rate of RMB to USD. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement in the currency rate against RMB, with all other variables held constant, on profit before tax. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a lessee’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations. The Group enters into transactions only with recognized and creditworthy third parties. In accordance with the policy of the Group, the Group examines and verifies the credit risk of all customers with whom the Group has credit transactions. Besides, the Group monitors and controls the interest-earning assets regularly to mitigate the risk of significant exposure to bad debts. Other financial assets of the Group include cash and bank deposits, accounts receivables and other receivables. The credit risk of these financial assets arises from the counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk equals to the carrying amounts of these assets. In determining the classification of its interest-earning assets, the Group applies a set of criteria pursuant to its internal policies. These criteria are designed to assess the likelihood of repayment by the borrower and the collectability of principal and interest on the interest- earning assets of the Group. Interest-earning assets classification criteria of the Group focus on a number of factors, to the extent applicable, and include the following criteria: Pass. There is no reason to doubt that the loan principal and interest will not be repaid by the lessee in full and/or in a timely manner. There is no reason whatsoever to suspect that the interest-earning assets will be impaired. Special Mention. Even though the lessee has been able to pay the lease payments in a timely manner, there are still some factors that could adversely affect its ability to pay. These factors include changes in economy, policies and regulations and industry environment, changes in property structures, significant negative events and significant fall in key financial indicators occurred to lessees, sharp lag of infrastructure projects behind the original plan, or heavy over- run of budget, impact of changes in core asset value on repayment abilities of the lessees, as well as emerging of position relating to guarantors impacting their financial and operating conditions. In addition, the Group takes into account impacts of subjective factors on asset quality such as changes in repayment willingness of the lessees, for example, if payments have been overdue and the financial position of the lessee has worsened, then the interest-earning assets for this lease contract should be classified as special mention or lower. Substandard. The lessee’s ability to pay the principal and interests of the interest-earning assets is in question as it is unable to make its payments in full with its operating revenues and the Group is likely to incur losses notwithstanding the enforcement of any guarantees. For example, if a lease payment that has been categorized as special mention continues to be overdue for a period of time, then the interest-earning assets for this lease contract should be classified as substandard or lower. Doubtful. The lessee’s ability to pay is in question as it is unable to make lease payments in full and on a timely basis with its operating revenues. Notwithstanding the enforcement of any guarantees underlying the lease contract, we are likely to incur significant losses. For example, if a lease payment that has been categorized as substandard continues to be overdue for a period of time, the interest-earning assets for this lease contract shall be classified as doubtful or lower. Loss. After taking all possible steps or going through all necessary legal procedures, lease payments remain overdue or only a very limited portion has been recovered. For example, if a lease payment that has been categorized as doubtful continues to be overdue for a period of time, the interest-earning assets for this lease contract shall be classified as a loss. Under the overall risk management framework, the Group fully participated in the asset management works, with multi-sectorial coordination and collaboration, to maintain the safety of assets and improve the asset quality. During the whole process of each of the finance lease project, the Group took risk management measures to monitor the quality of its asset portfolio, the quality of the assets underlying its leases and the efficiency of its credit assessment workflow. These measures are integrated into on-going asset management efforts of the Group with the following key features: Continuously improving the management process after the lease and regularly The Group continued to improve the management process after lease and strengthened the coordination of various departments to ensure the rent collection and the collateral security, as well as enhancing asset quality. During the year, the Group constantly monitored the collection of rental payments from our customers. For projects with overdue lease receivables, we would adopt a variety of measures to collect the overdue receivables, and collect data to facilitate our classification of risky assets. The Group formulated and implemented an annual on-site visit plan and inspected the business development and financial conditions of its customers on a continuing basis, during which cross-selling opportunities could also be explored for providing more value-added services. Through on-site visits, the customers would be urged to pay the rent on time more consciously and they would be more willing to communicate with the Group. The Group implemented a material events reporting system. If any material adverse event occurs to customers, a responsible department should take the lead and collaborate and coordinate with various departments to actively respond to the situation. Meanwhile, such event would need to be reported to the senior management and the Board. The Group adopted the expected credit loss model to classify its assets related to interest- earning assets. Under this categorization system, the Group’s assets related to interest-earning assets are divided into five categories, namely “pass”, “special mention”, “substandard”, “doubtful” and “loss”. The last three categories of assets are considered as non-performing assets. The Group applied a series of criteria in determining the classification of each of its assets, which focus on a number of factors, including (1) the customer’s ability to make lease payments; (2) the customer’s payment history; (3) the customer’s willingness to make lease payments; (4) the collateral provided for the lease; and (5) the possibility of legal enforcement in the event of delinquent lease payments. The Group closely monitored the asset quality by focusing on the aforementioned factors, and would decide whether to reclassify such assets and adopt appropriate measures to improve their management. The Group has also established concrete management measures for making relevant provisions for impairment to the extent such impairment is reasonably envisaged.

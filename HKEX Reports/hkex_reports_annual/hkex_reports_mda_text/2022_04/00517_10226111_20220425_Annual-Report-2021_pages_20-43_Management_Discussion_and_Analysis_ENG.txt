The Group continued to monitor and adjust its debt portfolio from time to time in light of market conditions, the objective of which is to reduce potential interest rate risk exposure, improve debt structure and lower interest expenses. As for cash management, the Group selects suitable cash investment instruments based on the balance among security, return and liquidity to ensure sufficient funds are available and an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained to meet all its obligations during different stages of the shipping cycle.

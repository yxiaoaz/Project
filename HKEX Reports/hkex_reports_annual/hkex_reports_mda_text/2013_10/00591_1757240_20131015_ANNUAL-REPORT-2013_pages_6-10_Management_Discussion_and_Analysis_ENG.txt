The board (the “Board”) of directors (the “Directors”) of China High Precision Automation Group Limited (the “Company”) is pleased to announce the audited consolidated annual results of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) for the year ended 30 June 2013 (the “Year”). China experienced a notable slowdown in macro-economic growth in the year past, with an average rate of 7.625%* in year- on-year gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth reported for the past 4 quarters ended 30 June 2013, as compared to an average growth rate of 8.425%* for the same periods last year, which represented a slowdown in the pace of economic growth by 0.8%. In the industrial sectors, year-on-year declines have been recorded in a number of indices, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of China, which fell by 0.6% to 50.3 for this financial year (Source: China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing), as compared to 50.9 (Source: China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing) for the same period last year, and China’s Value Added of Industry, for which an average growth of 9.36%* was reported for the year, decreased by 2.64% as compared to the growth of 12%* for the same period last year. These figures have indicated substantial uncertainties in the domestic economy over the past year. For the year ended 30 June 2013, the monthly average of China’s Producer Price Index was –2.5%* as compared to the growth of 2.2%* for the same period last year, representing a difference of 4.8%. In the sector of industrial automation instruments, both imports and domestic products were subject to ongoing to price corrections. The Company’s profit margin was under pressure as the prices of most of its products had been lowered. During the past year, the Company reported reduced revenue from its two business segments, namely automation instrument and technology products; and horological instruments, mainly as a result of the decline in demand and prices, with the decrease in prices weighing more heavily than the decrease in demand. Meanwhile, high-end controllers have been the most affected segment. Correction in the controller business is expected to last for some time, as the infrastructure-related sectors (such as steel manufacturing), where most of such controller products are taken up, are still facing the problem of excess production capacity. In the meantime, the domestic manufacturing industry continued to undergo structural transformation, as anticipated by the Company. Rising labour costs and difficulties for small and medium enterprises to secure financing continued to present problems to business operators, while cash turnover was a particularly prominent issue for domestic companies. In this connection, the Company has taken a range of risk management measures to mitigate the potential impact of the risks arising from bad debts. The Company will continue to adopt a conservative strategy in its business operations. The Group has the following two business segments: During the Year, sales of high precision industrial automation instrument and technology products amounted to approximately RMB428,624,000 (2012: approximately RMB757,116,000), representing approximately 83.0% (2012: approximately 87.2%) of the Group’s total turnover. The Group continued to focus on production and expansion of high precision industrial automation instrument and technology products, and to manage its inventory levels and its distribution network. Reportable segment profit of this business segment was approximately RMB93,843,000 (2012: approximately RMB330,706,000), representing a decrease of about 71.6% as compared to that of 2012. Sales of horological instruments were approximately RMB87,925,000 (2012: approximately RMB110,959,000), which accounts for approximately 17.0% (2012: approximately 12.8%) of the Group’s total turnover during the Year. This segment recorded reportable segment loss of approximately RMB6,932,000, as compared to a reportable segment profit of approximately RMB28,135,000 in The Group has large-scale production facilities and is expanding its production capacity to enhance its competitive strength. As the utilization rate of the existing manufacturing facility (1st phase development) of the Group located at Lot No. 15, Kuaian Road, Mawei Science and Technology Park, Fuzhou ( 15 ) has reached its maximum since 2008, the Group is in the process of expanding and upgrading its production capacity in two phases (i.e. 2nd and 3rd phase developments). Both developments are located at Long Men Village, Kuaian Technology Park, Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone ( ) in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”), covering a total site area of approximately 47,665 square metres. The 2nd phase development is solely for the expansion of the Group’s production capacity of its existing products. The factory on site commenced production in 2010 and reached its full-scale production capacity in June 2011; accordingly, the Group’s production capacity of its existing products has been doubled as scheduled. The 3rd phase development is solely for actuators, one of the Group’s new products. The construction was completed in 2012, and is expected to reach its full-scale production capacity in 2015. In light of the instability of the global market, the Directors will proceed with the future developments cautiously. While our business segments of horological instruments and automation instrument and technology products have reported lacklustre results for the year as a result of the weak sentiments prevailing in various traditional manufacturing industries, the Company is making strong efforts to adjust its customer base and product mix to address the changes in the current business environment. The Company has recently set up an oil and petrochemical department dedicated to the development of businesses with the oil, petrochemical and related industries, with a view to capitalising on opportunities in these sectors. Under the “12th Five-Year Plan” of the PRC Government, a number of integrated oil refinery and chemical plants are set to be constructed as part of the nation’s effort to build a modernised petrochemical industry with enhanced overall standards. Fujian Province, for example, has plans to build, by 2015, an aggregate refining capacity of over 29 million tonnes per annum for the province’s petrochemical industry that would deliver an industrial output value of over RMB400 billion, according to the Fujian Provincial Economic and Trade Commission. The Group is currently engaged in active marketing efforts to promote these products in relevant sectors. The research and development on product upgrades underlines another direction in the Group’s future development. The research and development of new models in pressure transmitters and transmitters with high levels of precision and reliability represents an important focus in the future operations of the Company. New models in pressure transmitters and transmitters will open up access to the oil and petrochemical industries and other high-end sectors for the Company’s products and will enable the Company to establish leadership in the industry with stronger brand recognition. Furthermore, the Company has successfully developed gauge valves (sets) and pipe connectors last year, and the marketing of these new products will be one of the Group’s important tasks in the coming year. In view of the above, the Group’s management remains optimistic about the Company’s development prospects. Turnover of the Group amounted to approximately RMB516,549,000 for the Year (2012: approximately RMB868,075,000), representing a decrease of about 40.5% as compared to that of last year. The decrease is mainly due to the adverse effect of the sluggish global economy which causes (i) decrease in demand of industrial automation instrument and technology products and (ii) decrease in unit selling price. During the Year, the Group’s gross profit and profit from operations amounted to approximately RMB104,071,000 (2012: approximately RMB392,768,000) and approximately RMB49,588,000 (2012: approximately RMB310,342,000) respectively. The decrease is in line with the decrease in turnover. The segment gross profit margin of automation instrument and technology products segment decreased from 47.6% for 2012 to 25.4% for the Year. It was mainly due to the decrease in unit selling price. The segment of horological instruments suffered a gross loss of approximately RMB4,767,000 for the Year while there was a gross profit of approximately RMB32,207,000 in 2012. It was because the average unit selling price decreased from RMB1.76 for 2012 to RMB1.29 for the Year. The Group adjusts its selling prices from time to time, if necessary, to maintain its market share in an intensely price competitive market. Accordingly, during the Year, the Group’s profit from operations decreased by 84.0% as compared to that of 2012. The profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company for the Year was approximately RMB36,277,000, as compared to that of approximately RMB259,193,000 in 2012.

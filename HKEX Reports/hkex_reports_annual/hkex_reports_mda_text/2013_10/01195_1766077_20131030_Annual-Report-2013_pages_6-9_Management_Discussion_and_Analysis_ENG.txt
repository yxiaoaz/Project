For the Year, revenue of the Group decreased by 42.8% to RMB160,232,000 (2012: RMB279,987,000). The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the decrease in the revenue from the electronic business. During the Year, the Group recorded a gross profit of approximately RMB21,556,000 (2012: gross profit of RMB12,396,000) and loss before tax of approximately RMB98,241,000 (2012: loss before tax of RMB168,067,000). The increase in gross profit and decrease in loss before tax were mainly due to the decrease in loss from the electronic business. The loss attributable to owners of the Company for the Year was RMB105,684,000 (2012: loss of RMB204,591,000). Basic loss per share was RMB7 cents (2012: basic loss per share was RMB14 cents). The Group is principally engaged in the electronic business. Its product has a broad range of applications in items such as consumer digital devices, automotive and medical devices. During the Year, unfavourable market condition in the global economy continued to pose various challenges to the electronic industry. Both the Group’s orders and average selling prices were under pressure and amid intense market competition. Rigid printed circuit boards (“RPCBs”) continued to remain as the Group’s core business. Being one of the largest producers in Fujian and leveraging on its strong client base, the Group continued to receive stable orders from existing clients and maintained its market share in the region. However, owing to the uncertain market conditions, average selling prices have not yet rebounded to previous levels. During the Year, revenue attributable from electronic business was approximately RMB77,064,000 (2012: RMB178,843,000) representing approximately 48.1% of the Group’s total revenue. The electronic business recorded a loss of RMB78,975,000 as compared with a loss of RMB150,181,000 in last year. The residential development project “Anlu Taihe Paradise” at Liang Ji Bei Road, Anlu Economic Development District in Anlu city, Hubei province in the PRC is wholly owned by the Group and is having positive contribution to the Group. The project comprises three phases, with a total gross floor area of approximately 272,568 square meters. The project marked the successful entry by the Group into the property development business and provided strong support in achieving the strategy of business diversification and generating new sources of income in order to improve the Group results during the Year. During the Year, revenue attributable from property development business was approximately RMB83,168,000 (2012: RMB98,835,000), representing approximately 51.9% of the Group’s total revenue. The property development business recorded a profit of RMB17,163,000, as compared with a profit of approximately RMB22,506,000 in last year. The Company acquired 51% equity interest in a gold mining company in Russian Federation and completed the acquisition on 15 August 2012. The gold mining company is a company established under the laws of Russian Federation with limited liability and currently operates and owns the legal and beneficial interest in a mining project related to the gold mine. With an aggregate mining area of about 309.3 square kilometers, the mine is operated by the gold mining company and located in Molchan river, Zeyskiy region, Amur area, the Russian Federation. The mine is estimated to have sand gold reserve of (C1 category) 35 tonnes. The gold mining company is in process of devising its production and exploitation plan. Geographically, sales within the PRC (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan) remained the largest segment, generating 89.2% (2012: 88.2%) of the Group’s revenue. The balance of approximately 10.8% of the Group’s revenue (2012: 11.8%) was taken up by the overseas customers. Looking forward, the intense competition in the electronic industry and unfavourable operating environment will continue to pose challenges to the electronic industry as well as the Group. The demand for electronic products recovered at a slow pace. Customers were still cautious in placing orders which added to the downward pressure of average selling prices. Due to the Fujian environmental production requirements, the Group will employ an environmental protection company to review the existing situations of the Fujian plant and to provide recommendations for capital investment to fulfill the environmental protection requirements in Fujian. Furthermore, the growing inflation in PRC led to rising raw material and labour costs, the shortage of labour force and the environmental production requirements increased production costs and undermined the profitability of the Group. In order to sustain the continuous growth of the Group and meet the coming challenges, the Group had successfully entered into the property development business through its property development project in Anlu city, Hubei province in the PRC. The real estate project, comprising various types of properties including villas, houses, apartments and commercial buildings, had made significant contribution to the Group during the Year. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to implement its diversified development strategy and proactively search for potential investment opportunities, particularly in gold mining projects. On 15 August 2012, the Group had completed the acquisition of 51% equity interest in a gold mine company in the Russian Federation. The acquisition provided the Group with a unique opportunity to purchase the gold mine and enabled the Group to enter into the gold mining industry.

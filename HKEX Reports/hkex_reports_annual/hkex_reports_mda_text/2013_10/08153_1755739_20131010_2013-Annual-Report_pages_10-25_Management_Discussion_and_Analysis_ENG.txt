At  the  request  of  the  Company,  the  trading  in  the  shares  of  the Company  in  Stock  Exchange  has  been  suspended  since  24  June 2013  due  to  an  enquiry  made  by  the  Financial  Reporting  Review Committee  into  the  Alleged  Non-compliance  2010  in  connection with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  for  the year ended 31 March 2010. The Alleged Non-compliance 2010 is related  to  certain  accounting  treatments  for  the  acquisition  of  the entire  equity  interest  in  Kang  Yuan  Universal  Investment  Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Kang Yuan Group”) on  1  February  2010  (the  “Acquisition”).  The  management  has been  proactively  dealt  with  the  issues.  With  close  consultation with  various  professionals  and  the  Group’s  current  auditors  and conduction  of  extensive  accounting  literature  examination  and due  diligence,  the  Alleged  Non-compliance  2010  and  subsequent significant  transactions  that  may  be  affected  have  basically  been resolved and reflected in this financial statements. The  Group  reported  loss  attributable  to  owners  of  the  Company for  the  year  ended  31  March  2013  (the  “Year”)  of  HK$248.8 million  (2012:  profit  of  HK$50.5  million).  The  Group’s  turnover  for the  Year  has  slightly  increased  by  10.7%  to  HK$734.7  million  as compared to same period last year of HK$663.9 million, and over 93.0% of the Group’s turnover was derived from the Group’s core business – the manufacturing and sale of agricultural machinery and related products and services. Gross profit for the Year has slightly increased by 2.1% to HK$234.1 million comparing with same period last  year  of  approximately  HK$229.4  million.  However,  the  gross profit margin has diminished obviously from same period last year of 34.6% to the Year of 31.9% due to the rising sheet steel costs and direct labour costs. During the Year under review, the Group has completed the disposal of  its  remaining  20%  equity  interest  in  Xian  Shenghua  Electronic Engineering Company Limited for a consideration of RMB6.0 million (equivalent  to  HK$7.4  million)  on  16  May  2012  and  disposal  loss of approximately HK$1.5 million was thereby recorded. On 29 May 2012, the Group has also finalised the disposal of its certain prepaid land lease payments and property and equipment with an aggregate net  carrying  amount  of  approximately  HK$128.4  million  (classified as assets held for sale), and the net sale proceeds of approximately RMB144.0  million  (equivalent  to  approximately  HK$176.8  million) was settled by offsetting against part of convertible bond issued by the Company to Cyberland (China) Limited (“Cyberland”). A disposal gain  of  approximately  HK$35.5  million  was  thereby  recorded.  For details, please refer to the circular published by the Company dated 29  April  2011.  Management  believed  the  aforesaid  disposal  could streamline  the  business  model  and  facilitate  better  utilisation  of resources of the Group. Code Agriculture (Holdings) Limited • Annual Report 2013 Tobacco  agricultural  business  is  conducted  via  Jiangsu  Kedi Modern  Agriculture  Co  Ltd  (“Jiangsu  Kedi”),  an  indirectly  wholly owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Jiangsu  Kedi,  being  the substantial  revenue  driver  of  the  Group,  is  a  leading  enterprise  in the  modern  tobacco  agricultural  machinery  production  and  is  one of  the  major  authorised  suppliers  of  the  China  National  Tobacco Corporation (“CNTC”). Jiangsu Kedi focuses on the manufacturing, sales  and  distribution  of  agricultural  machinery  –  intensive  flue- curing tobacco barn and other related products in the PRC. Most of its products are sold to the local counterparts of CNTC through public  tendering  and  bidding  procedures.  Since  the  intensive  flue- curing  barn  was  launched,  it  can  serve  flue-curing  for  20  mu  of tobacco  field  per  time  and  provide  semi-automatic  operation  for peasant.  The  intensive  flue-curing  barn  can  also  facilitate  the process  of  mechanisation  of  curing,  reducing  labour  input  and enhancing  the  production  efficiency.  The  business  of  Jiangsu Kedi  was  benefited  from  the  development  of  intensive  flue-curing technology. Revenue  from  this  operation  increased  by  8.4%  to  HK$684.1 million  (2012:  HK$631.2  million)  with  segment  gross  profit  slightly decreased  to  32.7%  from  last  year  of  35.3%.  The  sale  increment was  principally  due  to  the  strong  demand  of  flue-curing  barn  and accessories.  The  Group’s  “KH”  series,  in  particular,  the  KH-10  of metal and non-metal flue-curing barns with national standard were well  received  by  the  PRC  tobacco  market  for  its  reliability.  The products of KH series have full market coverage over major tobacco production  areas  in  the  PRC.  Meanwhile,  the  drop  in  gross  profit margin was mainly caused by the increase in direct labour cost and sheet steel cost which were the main raw materials in building the flue-curing barn. The  segment  recorded  a  loss  of  approximately  HK$124.7  million (2012:  HK$24.5  million)  which  was  mainly  attributed  to  the  non- cash  item,  impairment  losses  on  other  intangible  assets  of HK$135.4 million (2012: HK$77.2 million). Management realises that the mounting operating costs are engulfing the operation profit and pose immense pressure to the Group. In light of this, management will continue to take austerity measures to trim down administrative overheads  and  derive  certain  amount  of  resources  to  enhance the  sale  of  greenhouse  and  other  well  recognised  transplanting machine. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS (Continued) Revenue  from  sale  of  fertilizer  and  pesticide  has  increased  from same period last year of HK$29.4 million to current Year of HK$44.7 million,  representing  a  52.0%  growth.  Since  Henan  Baorong  has become the Group’s subsidiary in October 2012, it has contributed revenue of HK$4.9 million to this operation for the Year. Over  50%  of  the  revenue  of  this  segment  are  generated  from  the sale of pesticide products, the BM series – flumetralin and biological fertilizers which are generally applied in soil transformation for  tobacco  cultivation  and  the  growing  of  organic  tobacco. However, as peer competition amongst these products is so keen and cost for raw materials is likely to rise, it is difficult to expect a significant growth in sale in near future. Nevertheless, management holds the view that along with the synergy effect from the acquisition of Henan Baorong, it has broadened the Group’s product spectrum and enhanced the pool of expertise. Revenue  from  digital  television  operation  of  approximately  HK$6.3 million  (2012:  HK$4.8  million)  contributed  approximately  0.8%  to the  Group’s  overall  turnover.  This  operation  recorded  a  segment loss of HK$0.6 million (2012: loss of HK$21.6 million including one- off  impairment  loss  of  HK$20.0  million).  The  growth  in  turnover was  contributed  by  the  increase  of  advertising  income  as  a  result of  the  partial  unlocked  of  scientific  channels  in  Hunan  Province  of the PRC. However, as to the fact that digital television broadcasting is policy-driven and full of uncertainties, it is not expected to have any  exponential  increase  in  its  revenue  in  coming  years.  Yet,  the Company will continue to explore business opportunities within the industry and improve its product quality and operation efficiency. The  healthcare  products  operation  was  severely  underperformed with  revenue  of  approximately  HK$0.4  million  for  the  Year  (2012: HK$0.9  million)  and  recorded  a  segment  loss  of  approximately HK$5.4 million (2012: HK$5.1 million). The loss was mainly due the significant shrinkage in the demand of cordyceps-related healthcare products,  immense  pressure  from  peer  competition  and  rising operating  costs.  As  the  gloomy  business  environment  is  unlikely to  ease  and  yet  the  operating  costs  are  likely  standing  high  in forthcoming  years,  this  operation  is  not  optimistic.  In  light  of  this, the Group is now considering possible disposal of this operation if opportunity arises. Code Agriculture (Holdings) Limited • Annual Report 2013 For  the  Year  under  review,  the  Group’s  turnover  was  HK$734.7 million  (2012:  HK$663.9  million),  representing  a  growth  10.7% as  compared  to  same  period  last  year.  Turnover  from  tobacco agricultural  operation  which  accounts  for  93.0%  of  the  Group’s total turnover shows a growth of 8.7% to approximately HK$683.2 million (2012: HK$628.8 million). The growth was attributed to the strong  underlying  demand  of  intensive  flue-curing  machinery  and related accessories. As to the unique characteristic of the seasonal effect  of  tobacco  agricultural  industry,  over  70%  of  the  turnovers are generated in the first half of the Year. Turnover from fertilizer and pesticide operation and digital television operation for the Year were approximately HK$44.7 million (2012: HK$29.4 million) and HK$6.3 million  (2012:  HK$4.8  million)  respectively,  and  account  for  6.1% and 0.8% of the Group’s turnover respectively. The Group’s cost of goods sold mainly includes costs of inventories sold,  sheet  steel  and  direct  wages.  During  the  Year,  total  cost  of sales  and  services  was  HK$500.5  million  which  was  15.2%  more than  last  year  of  HK$434.5  million.  Gross  profit  for  the  Year  has slightly  increased  by  2.1%  to  HK$234.1  million  compared  with same  period  last  year  of  HK$229.4  million.  However,  the  gross profit  margin  has  diminished  obviously  from  last  year  of  34.6%  to current Year of 31.9% partially due to the rising labour cost, uprising sheet steel prices, logistic costs, production overheads and product mix.  The  pricing  of  sheet  steel  for  the  Year,  a  major  component in  construction  of  the  flue-curing  barns,  was  relatively  pricey  than same  period  last  year.  The  management  may  therefore  consider hedging on sheet steel cost, so as to minimise the its impact on the cost of production. FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The  Group’s  distribution  costs  which  mainly  consist  of  labour costs,  transportation,  travelling  expenses  and  business  soliciting expenditures, amount to HK$127.2 million (2012: HK$78.5 million), representing  an  increase  of  62.0%  compared  to  same  period last  year.  The  significant  increase  in  distribution  costs  was  mainly caused by the surge in number of times of delivery turnaround and transportation as a result of more sales orders but with less quantity involved that need to be fulfilled. Despite the Company’s tightening measures  over  the  operation  cost,  the  direct  labour  overheads which  account  for  approximately  18.5%  of  the  total  distribution costs  of  the  Year  has  increased  by  20.6%  as  compared  to  same period  last  year.  Therefore,  management  has  started  to  streamline the logistic arrangement to minimise distribution cost. As  a  result  of  austerity  measures  adopted  in  cost  control,  the administrative expenses for the Year was maintained at HK$135.4 million  (2012:  HK$137.4  million)  which  included  amortisation  and depreciation  with  aggregate  amount  of  HK$71.8  million  (2012: HK$70.1  million),  and  staff  costs  totally  of  HK$19.3  million  (2012: HK$24.4 million). With the challenging business environment ahead, the  Group  will  strive  to  strengthen  the  financial  effectiveness  with a  prudent  approach  to  control  the  Group’s  overall  administrative expenses. Loss from operations for the Year was HK$4.7 million, representing a sharp decrease of 7.3 times compared with same period last year (2012: profit HK$33.9 million). The loss from operation is caused by narrowing down of gross profit margin and surging distribution cost and relevant overheads. The Company foresees that the sheet steel cost,  direct  labour  cost  and  logistic  related  expenditure  are  likely rising in forthcoming year. Aggregate  gross  interest  expenses  on  bank  and  other  loans  for the  Year  was  HK$22.9  million,  representing  an  increase  of  7.3% compared  with  same  period  last  year.  Such  increase  was  mainly due to interest bearing loans increased during the reporting period. Code Agriculture (Holdings) Limited • Annual Report 2013 FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Alleged Non-compliance 2010 Regarding  the  Alleged  Non-compliance  2010  as  set  out  in  the Company’s announcements dated 21, 26 June and 2 August 2013, certain errors relating to accounting treatments or judgments have been  identified  in  the  Group  and  Company’s  financial  statements for  the  years  ended  31  March  2010,  2011  and  2012  (“Relevant Financial  Statements”).  The  management  come  to  aware  that these  errors  so  happened  were  mainly  arose  from  inappropriate judgement during the course of audit for the year ended 31 March 2010.  The  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  which  required the recognition and measurement of the net assets acquired of the Acquisition,  the  convertible  bond  issued,  valuation  modeling  and the  resultant  goodwill  involve  material  professional  judgment  and assumptions about future conditions whose outcome was uncertain and  complex.  Therefore,  the  Company  has  recently  conducted  a lot  of  analysis,  examinations  and  due  diligence  on  alleged  non- compliance issues and related accounting treatments and literature in  a  responsible  manner.  An  international  accounting  firm  was appointed to provide consultation services to the Company on how to address and document the accounting treatments in relation to the Acquisition, and a new and independent valuer, was specifically engaged to conduct the valuation of enterprises, convertible bond and other related valuations in connection with the Acquisition and subsequent  impairment  testing.  Having  remeasured  the  valuation of  Kang  Yuan  Group,  two  CGUs  instead  of  one  CGU  in  previous valuation  were  identified  by  management,  namely  “Tobacco Agricultural  Operation”  and  “Fertilizer  and  Pesticide  Operation”.  It was also noted that the working capital calculation adopted in the previous valuation for subsequent impairment testing of the CGUs did not comply with HKAS36 – Impairment of Assets. On top of the existing “technologies”, the Company has also identified five more other  intangible  assets,  namely,  tradename,  patents  and  license rights,  non-competition  agreements,  customer  relationships  and distribution network. In light of additional identifiable CGU, goodwill arising  from  the  Acquisition  was  properly  allocated  to  the  two identifiable CGUs. The accounting treatment of the convertible bond issued as part of consideration for the Acquisition was rectified and designated  as  a  financial  liability  through  profit  and  loss  on  initial recognition.

During  the  Year  under  review,  the  Group  generally  financed  its operations through internally generated cash flows and borrowings. As  at  31  March  2013,  the  Group  had  aggregated  cash  and  bank balance  and  pledged  deposits  of  approximately  HK$192.6  million (2012:  HK$421.0  million).  The  Group’s  current  ratio,  being  the current  assets  of  HK$993,466,000  (2012:  HK$1,310,136,000) divided  by  current  liabilities  of  HK$658,643,000  (2012: HK$887,369,000),  was  computed  as  1.51  (2012:  1.48)  which was  regarded  as  healthy  and  acceptable.  The  improvement  in current ratio was primarily attributed to the substantial reduction of bank  borrowings  of  HK$244.2  million  to  HK$502.8  million  (2012: HK$747.0 million) for the Year. The cash and cash equivalents was materially  reduced  to  HK$11.3  million  at  31  March  2013  (2012: HK$160.8  million).  However,  it  was  subsequently  replenished  by recovery of receivables after year end date.

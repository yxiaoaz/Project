Dear Shareholders, On behalf of the Board of Asia Resources Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the“Group”), I am pleased to present the audited consolidated results for the year ended 31 March 2011. For the year ended 31 March 2011, the turnover of the Group was HK$157,929,000 (2010: HK$135,320,000), an increase of 16.7% as compared with last year. Correspondingly, the Group had reduced its loss attributable to owners of the Company by 35.9% to HK$45,061,000 (2010: loss of HK$70,280,000). The reduction of loss were mainly attributable to (i) improvement of HK$2,418,000 in the manufacturing and sales of pharmaceutical products segment; (ii) gain on fair value change in respect of financial liability of HK$3,860,000 (convertible notes) reflected through profit or loss account; and (iii) decrease in loss on early redemption of promissory notes of HK$20,204,000. The basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2011 was HK1.39 cents (2010: basic and diluted loss per share of HK4.24 cents). During the year ended 31 March 2011, we have conducted an overall review on the Group’s performance and investments. We believed that an overhaul of the Group’s operations was necessary to safeguard the maximum interest of the shareholders. Danny Sun Lee Yang PT. Dampar Golden International PT. In respect of the intravenous fluids business, we have reviewed the progress and effect of the restructuring of the production plants in our factories. Consequently, we have found that the restructuring process to enhance the production capacity was proved to be successful in our Siping factory; it has resumed profitability during the year under review. However, the restructuring process in our Wenzhou factory was not yet succeeded, and its performance was not in line with the Group’s expectation. As a result, the factory in Wenzhou was disposed on 16 May 2011. The Group believes that the disposal of the Wenzhou factory creates a good opportunity for the Group to concentrate its resources in the Siping factory and the iron mine business. The business plan of the Mongolia Iron Mine was further delayed due to the resignation of the key personnel, Mr. Danny Sun and Ms. Lee Yang (both of them have extensive experience in resources industry) in September 2010. As a result of the delay, a decrease in fair value of Mining Right of HK$10,415,000 was recorded in accordance with the valuation report of an Independent Valuer. Since completion of the acquisition of 55% of the entire issued share capital in PT. Dampar Golden International (“PT. Dampar”) on 29 September 2010, the Company has set up an office and recruited local staffs in Surabaya so as to start up its trading of iron sand business in Indonesia. Also, we have engaged project managers to monitor the development of the said trading business in Indonesia. It is expected that the trading business will be commenced in the last quarter of 2011. In addition to maintaining stable operation of the existing business, the Group is actively exploring opportunities to achieve further business diversification, with an aim to broaden its revenue stream and earning base. We are confident to improve the overall efficiency of the Group and are committed to achieve satisfactory return for the shareholders. The Board does not recommend the payment of final dividend for the year (2010: nil). The operating environments of the Pharmaceutical Operation for the year under review were still full of challenges. During the fiscal year, the Group continued its tight control over costs and enhancement of operating efficiency. While we restructured the Wenzhou factory, the high and rising operating cost in Wenzhou City the PRC, like labor cost, production cost and very keen competition, caused the said factory still suffered a loss. In view of the unsatisfactory performance of the Wenzhou factory, the Board took a strategic initiative to dispose the factory on 18 March Whereas, for Siping factory, the restructure of enhancement of production capacity was found successful, increasing both its production and sales volumes, mitigating the impact of decline in selling price. As a result, the Group recorded an increase of approximately 16.7% in the revenue from this segment to approximately HK$157,929,000 as compared with approximately HK$135,320,000 of last year. With the increase in cost and decline in selling price, the gross profit for the segment decreased to approximately HK$50,296,000, representing a decrease of 6.4% as compared with approximately HK$53,763,000 last year. Having said that, we have successfully imposed tight control over the administration, distribution and selling expenses, thus this segment loss reduced to approximately HK$9,974,000, representing an improvement of 19.5% as compared with loss of approximately HK$12,392,000 last year. Looking forward to next year, with disposal of the poor performed Wenzhou factory in May 2011, the Group will continue improving the production capacity of the remaining factory in Siping, and incorporating effective control over administration, distribution and selling expenses. We have confidence to further enhance the financial results of the intravenous fluids business in the coming year. Since completion of the acquisition of the Mongolia subsidiary (Tian Sheng Group) in June 2009, the Mongolia Iron Mine operation was stagnant. The business plan was further postponed due to the resignation of the key personnel, Mr. Danny Sun and Ms. Lee Yang (both of them have extensive experience in resources industry) in September 2010. To deal with this, the company is in the course of re-considering the overall operating strategy for Mongolia Iron Mine. These include but not limited to the following possible approaches, (i) recruiting expertise staff to start the exploration & exploitation work of the Mongolia Iron Mine; (ii) leasing the exploration right of the Mongolia Iron Mine to third party; (iii) cooperating with other local mining companies which has exploration experience and expertise led by professional geologists, or (iv) disposing of the Mongolia Iron Mine. In respect of the iron mining business in Indonesia acquired on 29 September 2010, the Company has set up an office and recruited local staffs in Surabaya, so as to start up its trading of iron sand business in Indonesia. Project managers have been engaged to monitor the development of the said trading business in Indonesia. Separators machines have been ready and placed in the temporary warehouse at Lumajang, Indonesia, and will be installed in mine site once obtaining the necessary permit. It is expected that the trading business will be commenced in the last quarter of 2011. Accordingly, the Iron Ore Mine Operation segment recorded a loss of approximately HK$2,075,000 for the year ended 31 March 2011. The loss was mainly comprised of administrative expenses. During the year under review, the Group incurred non-cash finance costs of HK$16,511,000 as a result of the imputed interests on promissory notes (HK$5,147,000) and the convertible notes (HK$11,364,000) issued to the vendors of Mongolia Iron Mine and Indonesia Iron Mine business. In accordance with the valuation report of the equity component of the convertible note issued, fair value change in respect of financial liability of HK$3,860,000 (convertible note) was reflected through profit or loss account; this non-cash item enhanced our financial results accordingly.

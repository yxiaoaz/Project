For the year under review, the Group reported record-high total sales of HK$2,109.4 million, representing a substantial increase of 20.0% or HK$352.1 million as compared to total sales of HK$1,757.3 million for last year. Gross profit for the year increased by 26.5% to HK$405.8 million (2017: HK$320.9 million), and gross profit margin for the year rose by 0.9% from 18.3% to 19.2%. The Group’s profit before tax increased by 47.8% to HK$273.7 million (2017: HK$185.2 million), and profit margin before tax also increased by 2.5% from 10.5% to 13.0%. The substantial growth was mainly due to a gain of HK$47.1 million (2017: Nil) arising from the deregistration of a subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) incurred during the year. Excluding such deregistration gain and other income and gains, the Group’s operating profit before tax rose by 27.6% to HK$213.7 million (2017: HK$167.5 million) and the Group’s operating profit margin before tax rose by 0.6% from 9.5% to 10.1%. As the Group continued to optimise its marketing strategy, satisfactory performance in sales and profit was reported during the year under review. To strive for additional market shares, the Group continued to increase its production capacity through expansion of production lines, upgrade of production techniques and automation of production processes. Moreover, the Group adjusted its business strategy during the year. In the past, the Group had focused on functional products for the autumn and winter seasons, such that the peak production season for the Group had been the first half of the year given the requirement to deliver autumn and winter products before the winter season began, and the production capacity had not been fully utilised during the second half of the year. To address this problem, the Group shifted part of its production capacity to manufacture products less susceptible to the seasonal factor during the year under review and reduce the proportion of functional products for the autumn and winter seasons. On one hand, as a result of benefitting from efficient use of raw materials with increase in sales volume, the Group’s overall raw material costs decreased year-on-year consequently, improving the gross profit margin of the Group. Nevertheless, on the other hand, with the continuous increase in workers’ wage and welfare, the increase in the Group’s manufacturing costs had eroded the gross profit margin, resulting in a net increase of the Group’s gross profit margin of 0.9%. As a result of the increase in sales, the Group’s selling and distribution expenses increased by HK$11.0 million, comparable to that of last year as a percentage of total sales. Administrative expenses increased by HK$26.8 million mainly due to increase in staff salaries on annual reviews and increase in provision for bonus in line with the Group’s excellent results for the year under review. Interest expenses for the year increased by HK$0.9 million (or 32.7%) compared to last year in line with the increase in the average outstanding balance of bank loans and the average interest rate on bank loans during the year. In respect of taxation, the Group’s overall tax expenses increased by HK$13.6 million (or 45.3%). Excluding the gain on deregistration of a PRC subsidiary, the effective tax rate during the year was 19.3% (2017: 16.2%). The increase in effective tax rate was due to the utilisation of deferred tax asset arising from tax losses of Jiangxi Plant recorded in prior year. Other income and gains amounted to HK$12.8 million (2017: HK$17.6 million), comprising mainly financial award granted by the PRC Government amounting to HK$3.9 million (2017: HK$8.3 million), gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment and prepaid land lease payments amounting to HK$2.4 million (2017: HK$5.9 million) and bank interest income of HK$1.8 million (2017: HK$2.1 million). Profit attributable to owners of the Company amounted to HK$230.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2018, representing an increase of 48.3% compared to HK$155.1 million for last year. Net profit margin increased by 2.1% from 8.8% to 10.9%. Excluding the gain on deregistration of a PRC subsidiary and other income and gains, the Group’s net profit rose by 23.7% to HK$170.1 million (2017: HK$137.5 million) and the Group’s net profit margin rose by 0.3% from 7.8% to 8.1%. Basic earnings per share for the year amounted to HK46.0 cents compared to HK31.0 cents for last year. The Board proposed to recommend payment of a final dividend of HK12 cents (2017: HK6 cents) per share. Together with the interim dividend of HK18 cents per share paid during the year, the dividend payout ratio for the year was 65.2% (2017: 67.6%).

As at 31 March 2018, the Group had cash and bank balances amounted to HK$222.9 million (31 March 2017: HK$290.9 million) mainly denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi (“RMB”), US dollars and Indonesian Rupiah.

During the Reporting Period, the Group’s financial results was principally derived from the sales of petro-chemical products, the contract manufacturing and sales of smart cards and the provision of management and financial consultancy services. During the Reporting Period, sales of petro-chemical products conducted by Shanghai Phoenitron and its subsidiary amounted to HK$2,192.6 million (2014: HK$260.4 million) and has become the key revenue generator of the Group. During the Reporting Period, the Group’s revenue generated from the smartcard business amounted to HK$135.4 million, down by HK$58.8 million or 30.3% as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 of HK$194.2 million, among which HK$79.9 million (2014: HK$131.2 million) and HK$55.5 million (2014: HK$63.0 million) were attributable to the traditional SIM cards business and the module packaging and testing service business respectively. In terms of geographical segments, while the module packaging and testing service business is principally serving the PRC customers, the SIM cards business is serving both the overseas market and the PRC market. During the Reporting Period, revenue generated from the overseas market segment of SIM cards business amounted to HK$55.4 million, representing a drop of HK$36.6 million or 39.8%, as compared to HK$92.0 million in 2014. The drop in revenue over the prior year for the overseas market segment was due to the fact that Intercard is no longer purchasing card-bodies from a designated third party supplier of certain customers (which reduces revenue, but improves the Group’s smartcard gross profit margins). On the other hand, revenue generated from the PRC market segment for both the SIM cards business and the module packaging and testing service business was adversely affected by the slowdown of the PRC economy, and lower demand from leading PRC telecommunication market customers during the Reporting Period as they consumed existing stock which has adversely affected the SIM cards contract manufacturing industry. Revenue generated from the provision of management and financial consultancy services amounted to HK$5.9 million during the Reporting Period (2014: HK$5.9 million). No trading of scrap metals was conducted as the scrap metal prices slumped during the Reporting Period. During the Reporting Period, cost of sales (“COS”) increased by HK$1,876.4 million, or 431.4%, from HK$435.0 million for the corresponding period in 2014, to HK$2,311.4 million. The increase in COS was largely attributable to the incurrence of COS in relation to sales of petro-chemical products of HK$2,185.6 million (2014: HK$259.3 million) as Shanghai Phoenitron and its subsidiary ran the business for a full financial year of 2015. However, the increase in COS was partially offset by (i) the drop in COS of HK$48.6 million in relation to the smartcard business which was attributable to the drop in sales relating to the PRC market for both module packaging and testing service business and the SIM card business (in fact, an impairment loss on obsolete stock of HK$2.1 million was provided for and included in the COS to reflect the stagnant PRC market), and also to a larger extent, the cessation of purchasing third party card-body for the overseas market of SIM cards business); and (ii) the drop in COS relating to trading of scrap metals business of HK$1.3 million, as no trading of scrap metal prices was conducted during the Reporting Period. As a result, gross profit decreased by HK$4.3 million or 16.2%, from the corresponding period in last year of HK$26.9 million, to HK$22.6 million. Other revenue of HK$40.5 million (2014: HK$53.3 million) was mainly comprised of interest income arising from the amount due from a joint venture and bank deposits. The drop was attributable to the adjustment (downward) on interest rate charged to a joint venture and also due to the fact that an adjustment on interest income was made in last year for the under-provision in prior periods. No fair value loss was provided for in respect of the Reporting Period (2014: HK$46.3 million). During the Reporting Period, other losses amounted to HK$4.76 million (2014: HK$0.55 million) which was represented primarily by the exchange losses of HK$4.49 million arising from foreign currency-based transactions (2014: HK$0.50 million), loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of HK$0.16 million (2014: HK$0.05 million) and loss on disposal of long-term investment (Tecsun Goldcard) of HK$0.11 million (2014: HK$Nil). During the Reporting Period, selling and distribution costs amounted to HK$7.06 million, representing a drop of HK$0.37 million, or 5.1%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 of HK$7.43 million. The drop was mainly attributable to the drop in freight charges and transportation costs in the PRC’s SIM card business segment as revenue derived from it dropped significantly during the Reporting Period, and it was also partly attributable to the drop in overseas travelling expenses but such decrease was partly offset by the increase in staff costs for the module packaging and testing service business segment as salespersons were recruited for promoting the business. Administrative expenses recorded an increase of HK$6.09 million or 18.7% over the corresponding period in 2014 to HK$38.69 million (2014: HK$32.60 million). The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in corporate legal and professional fee of HK$1.25 million, the increase in various expenses of a total of HK$1.34 million in relation to our sales of petro-chemical products segment that was running for a full financial year in 2015, written off of property, plant and equipment of HK$2.55 million and a provision of staff layoff compensation of HK$0.90 million was made for the SIM card business segment in the PRC (reason as disclosed in the “Chairman’s Statement” section). No impairment was recognised in respect of the Reporting Period (2014: HK$92.3 million). No impairment was recognised in respect of the Reporting Period (2014: HK$27.8 million). During the Reporting Period, the Group’s finance costs amounted to HK$1.61 million (2014: HK$5.92 million). The drop was due largely to the interest payment for the first three quarters of 2014 in relation to the certain convertible bonds of the Company which were fully redeemed by end of 2014. During the period under review, the income tax expense of the Group amounted to HK$3.93 million (2014: HK$0.59 million). The increase was attributable to (i) the increase in EIT payment of HK$1.13 million by Shanghai Phoenitron that was conducting the sales of petro-chemical products in Shanghai throughout the Reporting Period; (ii) the increase in Hong Kong tax expenses of HK$0.33 million as the assessable profits derived by Intercard increased (better performance of the overseas SIM card market) and (iii) there was an adjustment made in last year regarding the overprovision of HK tax in prior years of HK$1.14 million. As a result of the foregoing, profit attributable to the owners of the Company in 2015 amounted to HK$5.5 million (2014: loss of HK$133.8 million).

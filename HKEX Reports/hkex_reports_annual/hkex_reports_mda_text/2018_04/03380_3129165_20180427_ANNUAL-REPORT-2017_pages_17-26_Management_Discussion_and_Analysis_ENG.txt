The Group’s financial conditions, results of operations, businesses and prospects may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties. The following are the key risks and uncertainties identified by the Group. There may be other risks and uncertainties which are not known to the Group or which may not be material now but could turn out to be material in the future. The business of the Group is highly dependent on the performance of the PRC property market. Any property market downturn in China generally or in the cities and regions in which the Group’s property projects are located, or lack of suitable land banks/reserves for project development could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial position. Further, property development is capital intensive in nature. Whilst the Group finances its property projects primarily through a combination of pre-sale and sale proceeds, borrowings from financial institutions and internal funds. If no adequate financing can be secured or any failure to renew the Group’s existing credit facilities prior to their expiration may adversely impact the Group’s operation. The Group primarily operates its business in the PRC. The currency in which the Group denominates and settles substantially all of its transactions is Renminbi. Any depreciation of Renminbi would adversely affect the value of any dividends the Group pay to shareholders outside of the PRC. The Group currently does not engage in hedging activities designed or intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk. The Group will continue to monitor foreign exchange changes to best preserve the Group’s cash value.

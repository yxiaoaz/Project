The Group is primarily engaged in sale, development and manufacturing of lead-acid batteries, which are conducted by its in-house teams under a vertically integrated management model. The Group sells over 2,000 models of lead-acid battery products, ranging in capacity from 0.251 Ah to 4,055 Ah. Among the PRC battery manufacturers, the Group offers one of the broadest lines of lead-acid batteries. For the year ended 31 December 2012 (the “Period”), the Group’s revenue amounted to RMB3,248.0 million, representing an increase of 2.7% from RMB3,164.1 million in 2011. Lead-acid batteries are classified into three market categories, namely reserve power batteries, SLI batteries and motive power batteries. Details of business operations of the Group in the three lead-acid battery categories, namely reserve power batteries, SLI batteries and motive power batteries, are as follows: Reserve power batteries: Reserve power battery products are further classified into four major application areas, namely uninterrupted power supply system (“UPS”), telecommunications, other consumer products and renewable energy. Reserve power batteries are the major revenue generator of the Group. The Group’s sales of reserve power batteries during the Period amounted to RMB2,371.3 million, representing a decrease of 8.0% from 2011. The decrease was attributable to the dwindling sales in two categories of UPS and telecommunications, whereas consumer product batteries and renewable energy batteries witnessed growth in sales. The Group’s decreased sales in UPS category was due to a temporary difficulty in meeting the needs of customer orders, as a result of the production suspension and rectification under governmental regulation during certain periods in 2011 and 2012 at the Group’s three production bases in Zhaoqing, Shenzhen and Dongguan which account for a majority of the Group’s production capacity of UPS batteries. The Group’s decreased sales in telecommunications category was mainly due to a reduction in orders arising from the decreased overall investments of telecom customers in 2012. The category of other consumer products, one of the most competitive products of the Group, experienced growth in its sales during the Period which was attributable to the increasing market share of the Group in such product category. The Group’s sales in renewable energy batteries increased due to the widespread application of emerging renewable energy, such as solar and wind power generation worldwide. SLI batteries: SLI batteries are used mainly in starting automobiles and motorcycles. The Group’s sales of SLI batteries during the Period amounted to RMB761.1 million, representing a substantial increase of 102.9%. The increase was attributable to a significant production growth in SLI batteries for automobiles and motorcycles, as a result of the Group’s higher capacity utilization rate in the Period. Motive power batteries: Motive power batteries are mainly used to provide power for electric vehicles such as forklifts, golf cars and electric bicycles and other portable devices. During the Period, the Group recorded sales revenue of RMB88.6 million, representing a decrease of 50.2%. In view of the fierce competition in electric bicycle battery industry, the Group geared down its investment in this category, resulting in the decreased sales in motive power batteries during the Period. The Group distributes its products to more than 100 countries and regions across the world. The Group’s regional sales centres are located in Beijing, Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, Nanjing, the United States, the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, together with 34 domestic sales centres across the PRC. Currently, the Group has over 500 dedicated sales and after-sales employees. The Group will continue expanding its sales teams and marketing network to support sales, distribution, and after- sales services for the reserve power batteries, SLI batteries and motive power batteries of the Group. The Group is a leader in R&D and application of lead- acid battery technologies in China. The Group’s battery research and development team consists of more than 400 researchers and technicians. To support its R&D efforts, the Group works closely with international and domestic battery experts and research institutions to develop new technologies. Currently, the Group holds 369 patents and other 390 proprietary technologies are in the process of patent applications. The Group has grasped and applied most of lead-acid battery technologies in the world, including technologies used in the first generation open-type fluid infusion battery, the second generation Absorbent Glass Mat (“AGM”) battery and new energy battery, the third generation pure lead battery, and the fourth generation Stop-Start battery. The Group is one of a handful of enterprises in the world possessing the third and the fourth generations of technologies. The Group’s strong R&D capabilities enable it to produce a broad range of battery products deploying most of the key lead-acid battery technologies. Currently, the Group has developed more than 2,000 models of battery products of different types employing various application technologies, making the Group one of the battery enterprises with the broadest range of lead-acid batteries. During the Period, the Group operated eight production bases, including five wholly-owned production bases in the PRC, a production base in Sri Lanka and two joint venture production bases in Malaysia, with a total site area of approximately 910,000 sq.m.. Currently, most new production bases have completed infrastructure works with production equipment installed, and have commenced trial production. As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s production capacity has increased to 11.0 million KVAh from 9.6 million KVAh as at the end of 2011. The Group will vigorously expedite the commissioning of the production bases to further expand its production and manufacturing capacities. Lead is the main raw material of lead-acid batteries and accounts for a major sales cost for the Group’s battery production. According to Shanghai Metals Market, an information service provider of non-ferrous metal market, lead prices were generally declining under slight fluctuation during the year. Domestic average lead price decreased from RMB16,328 per ton in 2011 to RMB15,291 per ton in 2012, representing a decrease of approximately 6.4%. To cope with potential risks of fluctuations in lead price, the Group adopts a price linkage mechanism, passing raw materials price fluctuations to customers to hedge relevant risks. The Group’s centralized procurement of raw materials enables it to trim down costs of raw materials through favourable negotiations on bulk purchase contracts. Shenzhen Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd. and Dongguan Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd., two subsidiaries of the Group that engage in the assembly and production of lead- acid batteries, suspended production for self-examination in 2011. The two subsidiaries, with a focus on reserve power battery products, accounted for only 3.5% of the comprehensive production capacity of the Group. Dongguan Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd. has resumed production since 18 January 2012, while Shenzhen Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd. has closed its production capacity. Zhaoqing Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the Group that engages in the production of lead-acid batteries, suspended production for self-examination and rectification in July 2012 as required by local authorities to cooperate with the local government for a special environment protection campaign. Zhaoqing Leoch Battery Technology Co., Ltd., with a focus on reserve power battery products, accounted for approximately 20% of the comprehensive production capacity of the Group in 2012. Batteries, one of the necessities in modern society, are mainly used in UPS at data centres of computer networks, automobiles, motorcycles, telecommunication base stations, train, subway, solar and wind power stations, substations, electric vehicles, elevators, backup lights and medical equipment. As such equipment industries have been dominated by European and American countries, the accessory batteries are also manufactured overseas traditionally. However, the surging application of such equipment amid the urbanization paces of the PRC is pushing forward a shift for such equipment to be manufactured domestically. Hence, the Group believes that the lead-acid battery market will enjoy continuous growths as driven by domestic industry upgrading and the ongoing shift of the high-end industries from overseas. The Group anticipates that lead-acid batteries will sustain the growth momentum in three categories, namely reserve power batteries, SLI batteries and motive power batteries. To grasp these market opportunities, the Group has formulated the following strategic plans for the three categories of lead-acid batteries: Reserve power batteries: Equipment manufacturers and operators are the Group’s major customers. Reserve power battery products have four major application areas, namely UPS, telecommunications, other consumer products and renewable energy. The Group had been affected by insufficient production capacity during the period on these four major application categories. The Group expects to expand the supply of reserve power battery products with its new production capacity coming on stream. The Group also believes that in the long run, reserve power batteries will sustain the growths in all the four categories as high-tech industries are taking over low- end industries in the urbanization and industry upgrading progresses of the PRC, leading to escalating demand for various high-end electric equipment products. The Group has exerted all its efforts to expand the market share to secure its leading position in the domestic market of reserve power batteries. SLI batteries: China is in the process of urbanization. Urban population in the PRC for the first time in history exceeded rural population in 2012. The urbanization progress is expected to further spread from dozens of major metropolises to over 200 second-tier cities and more than 3,000 third-tier cities, leading to higher urbanization rate of the PRC and thus the increasing transportation demand within and among domestic cities and towns. China has been ranking first in vehicle production and sales in the world since 2010. A consensus is therefore achieved in the market that the momentum of vehicle production and sales in China will continue from 2013 to 2022, further multiplying the demand for SLI batteries. The Group has strengthened its investment in SLI batteries, aiming to become one of the leading suppliers of SLI batteries for automobiles in China. Motive power batteries: The demand for motive power batteries has been propelled by the extensive promotion and application of the batteries in electric transportations such as electric bicycles, low- speed battery vehicles and forklifts. However, in view of the market uncertainties among fierce competition by crowded manufacturers of electric bicycle batteries, the Group intends to maintain its current market share and withhold additional investments before the market becomes more visible. For the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group’s revenue amounted to RMB3,248.0 million, representing an increase of 2.7% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011. The profit attributable to owners of the Company amounted to RMB71.1 million, representing a decrease of 74.7% compared to the year ended 31 December 2011. Earning per share for the year ended 31 December 2012 was RMB0.05. The Group’s revenue increased by 2.7% from RMB3,164.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB3,248.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The revenue of reserve power batteries decreased by 8.0% from RMB2,578.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB2,371.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The revenue of SLI batteries increased by 102.9% from RMB375.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB761.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The revenue of motive power batteries decreased by 50.2% from RMB178.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB88.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. Details of the Group’s revenue for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2012 by category of batteries are set out below: Product category Revenue Share increase Revenue Reserve power batteries (8.0% ) 2,578,549 SLI batteries Motive power batteries (50.2% ) Other (16.6% ) Total Geographically, the Group’s customers are principally located in Mainland China, the United States of America, European Union and other Asian countries/areas. The Group recorded growth in its sales in the United States of America, European Union and other areas while there was reduction in sales in Mainland China and other Asian countries/areas in particular India. The Group’s sales revenue in Mainland China decreased by 5.7% from RMB1,552.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB1,463.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, representing 45.1% of the Group’s total revenue (for the year ended 31 December 2011: 49.0%). The decrease was mainly attributable to the decreased sales in telecommunications category due to a reduction in overall investments of domestic telecom operators, which are major customers of the Group’s telecommunication batteries. The Group’s sales revenue in the United States of America and European Union increased by 4.0% and 20.7% from RMB489.5 million and RMB522.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB508.9 million and RMB630.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, respectively. The increase was principally due to the shifting of orders of these overseas customers to the Group, given the higher competitiveness of the Group’s products over the European and American rivals as a result of the Group’s strengthened technology upgrading for its products. The Group’s sales revenue in other Asian countries/areas decreased by 6.0% from RMB486.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB456.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The decrease was principally due to the decrease in sales in India as a result of the depreciation of Indian currency which reduced the competitiveness of certain models of the Group’s products manufactured in China. The Group’s sales revenue from battery products in other countries increased by 66.0% from RMB113.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB188.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The increase was attributable to the higher market competitiveness of the Group’s products as a result of the improving technological edge over European battery manufacturers, the traditional suppliers in such countries which mainly include Africa and South America. The revenue information following is based on the location of the customers for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2012: increase/ (decrease) Share Mainland China (5.7% ) 1,552,594 United States of America European Union Other Asian countries/areas (6.0% ) Other countries Total The Group’s cost of sales increased by 5.8% from RMB2,510.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB2,655.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The increase was mainly attributable to the dampened capacity utilization rate and additional expenses due to the increased environmental investments for overall improvements in environmental facilities of the Group’s plants, which led to a faster growth percentage in cost of sales than sales revenue accordingly. The Group’s gross profit decreased by 9.4% from RMB653.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB592.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly attributable to the higher growth percentage of depreciation and staff costs than that of sales during the Period. The overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.7% for the year ended 31 December 2011 to 18.2% for the year ended 31 December 2012. Other income and gains decreased by 38.7% from RMB70.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB43.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, which was primarily due to the decrease in government grants during the Period. The Group’s selling and distribution costs increased by 40.2% from RMB114.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB159.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, primarily due to the expansion in sales network as the Group further penetrated into the SLI battery sector and the increase of transportation charges. The Group’s administrative expenses increased by 27.8% from RMB179.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB229.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the increased administrative staff in order to strengthen management for continuous expansion during the Period. The development expenditure of the Group increased by 40.6% from RMB66.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB93.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. The increase in expenditure was mainly used for performance enhancement of existing products and development of new products, enhancement of product competitiveness and increased commitment in research and development. The Group’s other operating expenses increased by 84.1% from RMB6.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB12.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the increase in impairment provision of assets. The Group’s finance costs increased by 115.8% from RMB29.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB62.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the increase of borrowings during the Period. As a result of the foregoing factors, the Group recorded profit before income tax of RMB76.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 compared to RMB328.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2011, representing a decrease of 76.7%. Income tax expense decreased by 89.1% from RMB44.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB4.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, mainly due to the decrease in profit. As a result of the foregoing factors, the Group’s profit for the Period decreased by 74.7% from RMB283.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to RMB71.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2012. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had net current assets of RMB324.0 million (31 December 2011: RMB818.1 million). The Group’s current assets mainly consist of inventories, trade and bills receivables, cash and bank balances, and prepayments, deposits and other receivables. The Group’s current liabilities mainly consist of trade and bills payables, other payables and accruals, and interest-bearing bank borrowings. Inventories constituted one of the principal components of the Group’s current assets. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had inventories of RMB847.1 million (31 December 2011: RMB991.0 million). The decrease in inventories was primarily due to the enhancement in inventory management by the Group to optimize inventory. The Group’s trade and bills receivables primarily relate to receivables for goods sold to its customers. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had trade and bills receivables of RMB939.7 million (31 December 2011: RMB804.1 million). The increase in trade and bills receivables was primarily because the Group further expanded the market, adjusted its marketing strategies, purchased credit insurance for some quality customers and thus extended the payment term of those customers. The Group principally makes prepayments and deposits in connection with its purchase of raw materials, the large majority of which relates to its prepayments for raw materials. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had prepayments, deposits and other receivables of RMB130.5 million (31 December 2011: RMB159.4 million). The decrease in prepayments, deposits and other receivables was primarily because the Group decreased the prepayments of raw materials. The Group’s trade and bills payables primarily relate to its purchase of raw materials that the Group requires for its production process. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had trade and bills payables of RMB1,006.9 million (31 December 2011: RMB547.9 million). The increase in trade and bills payables was mainly because the Group invested the retained capital into property, plant and equipment. The Group’s other payables and accruals primarily consist of payments for its expenditures related to construction and outfitting of its production facilities, payments it makes in connection with transportation charges, advance payments that some international customers make to it in advance of its shipments, deferred government grants, and payroll and benefits for its employees and staff. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had other payables and accruals of RMB270.8 million (31 December 2011: RMB246.6 million). During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group invested RMB689.2 million (31 December 2011: RMB777.6 million) in construction in progress and property, plant and equipment for its new production facilities. As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s net current assets amounted to RMB324.0 million (31 December 2011: RMB818.1 million), among which cash and bank deposits amounted of RMB848.3 million (31 December 2011: RMB348.2 million). As at 31 December 2012, the Group had bank borrowings of RMB1,394.5 million (31 December 2011: RMB1,071.6 million), all of which are interest-bearing. Except for borrowings of RMB30.4 million which has a maturity over two years, all of the Group’s bank borrowings are repayable within two years. The Group’s borrowings are denominated in Euro, RMB, US dollars, HK dollars and Singapore dollars, and the effective interest rates of which as of 31 December 2012 were 1.0% to 7.8% (31 December 2011: 1.0% to 7.9%). A portion of the Group’s bank borrowings are secured by pledges over certain assets of the Group including property, plant and equipment, leasehold lands, deposits and trade and bills receivables. As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s gearing ratio was 27.4% (31 December 2011: 25.2%), which was calculated by dividing total borrowings by total assets as at the end of each respective period, multiplied by 100%. The Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2012 (31 December 2011: nil). The Group operates primarily in the PRC. For the Group’s companies in the PRC, their principal activities are transacted in RMB. For other companies outside of the PRC, their principal activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, as a result of the Group’s revenue being denominated in RMB, the conversion of the revenue into foreign currencies in connection with expense payments is subject to PRC regulatory restrictions on currency conversion. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, change in PRC’s political and economic conditions. The Group’s product sales adopted price mechanism by which the currency fluctuation is basically transferred to the customers, but the Group’s foreign currency trade receivables may still be exposed to risk in the credit period. The Group commenced using forward currencies contracts in the year 2012 to eliminate the foreign currency exposures arise from sales denominated in US$ with total amount of US$5 million (2011: nil). The forward currency contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item, i.e. US$. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had 8,529 employees. Employee benefit expense (including directors’ and chief executive’s remuneration), which comprise wages and salaries, performance related bonuses, equity-settled share option expenses and retirement benefit scheme contributions, totalled RMB435.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 (the year ended 31 December 2011: RMB434.2 million). The Group did not experience any significant labour disputes that lead to any material impact on its normal business operations.

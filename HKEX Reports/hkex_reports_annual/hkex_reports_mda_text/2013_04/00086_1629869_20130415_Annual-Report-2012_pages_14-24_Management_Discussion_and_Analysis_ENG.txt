amongst a fixed income investor base. The initiative also introduces a layer of longer-duration funding in addition to our banking facilities, and provides us with the option to reduce our reliance on funding asset growth through equity.

Total equity attributable to owners of the Company amounted to HK$12.9 billion, equivalent to HK$5.95 per share. Turnover increased by 4% to HK$3,723.4 million in 2012. Interest income, accounting for 83% of turnover, increased by 11%, driven primarily by Consumer Finance. In contrast, non-interest income, which mainly comprises commissions and fees, declined by 22% due to weaker volumes, in line with market conditions generally. Total loans and advances to customers (after impairment allowances) as shown below, amounted to HK$13.3 billion at the end of 2012, an increase of 4% since 2011. Profit attributable to owners of the Company was HK$1,036.4 million, compared to HK$1,032.4 million achieved in the year 2011. Earnings per share amounted to HK48.9 cents (2011: HK48.8 cents) and the Board has recommended a final dividend of HK12 cents per share. Together with the interim dividend of HK10 cents per share, it makes a total of HK22 cents per share for the full year. The Company repurchased 15.9 million shares for a total consideration (including expenses) of HK$65.9 million. During the past year, operating conditions varied significantly for the Group’s different businesses. Our Consumer Finance business in Mainland China, operating under UAF, continued to grow. This growth was founded upon the market’s increasing acceptance of our services and the extension of our branch network. UAF’s total principal loan balance in Mainland China increased by 69%, with a healthy increase in turnover of 72%. As a result, the Consumer Finance business in Mainland China, accounted for 25% of the Group’s total turnover in 2012. UAF’s Hong Kong business on the other hand remained relatively stable in the face of increased competition from the major banks. Conditions facing Sun Hung Kai Financial businesses (comprising our Wealth Management and Brokerage, and Capital Markets segments) were more challenging, with Hong Kong stock market trading and IPO fund raising volumes dropping by 23% and 65% respectively compared to However, overall, the Group’s blend of activities has enabled it to maintain a generally healthy financial position and to enhance shareholders’ value, the Group continues its strategies to: prudently grow the Group’s loan business while maintaining a balance on yield relative to risk; grow fee income in the Sun Hung Kai Financial businesses through new customer segments and products, while emphasis will be placed on products with a lower correlation with the market, such as wealth management improve our balance sheet structure and efficiency. Currently the Group’s return on equity (“ROE”) is 8.1%, with a healthy return on assets of 5.6%. The ultimate goal for the Group is to move the ROE up towards the teens. In September 2012, the Group raised US$350 million from the debt market by issuing guaranteed notes due in 2017 (6.375% coupon) to professional investors under its US$2 billion Guaranteed Medium Term Note Programme established in June 2012. The issue is a first for the Group under the Programme, which aims to build up support Sun Hung Kai & Co. Limited Annual Report 2012 As at As at Loan Balances: Margin loans (Wealth Management and Brokerage segment) Secured term loans (Capital Markets segment) Interest Income: Operating earnings before bad and doubtful debts grew by 6%. However, bad and doubtful debts were higher. For the Consumer Finance business, actual write offs (amounts directly deducted from the allowance of impairment) increased by 34% to HK$366.7 million. This is regarded as being still at a reasonable level given the growth in the business and the general market situation. The impairment allowance increased by HK$53.2 million in 2012, compared to a release of impairment allowance of HK$54.4 million in 2011. Bad debts were also incurred in Sun Hung Kai Financial’s margin and secured term loan books. Approximately half of the write offs related to one client in the structured finance business, which was an isolated event. As a result, operating earnings in total declined by 14% to HK$1,328.4 million. However, other income was boosted by the gain from disposal of some available-for-sale investments. This, together with a significant increase in profit from financial instruments, led to a rise in profit before tax of about 5%.

Global markets started 2012 on a positive note, followed by weakness in the second quarter due to investor concerns over the European debt crisis and a slow and erratic recovery in major global economies. In September 2012, the Despite a better year for the index, the volume of equity trading was lower across all major bourses. In 2012, The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”) traded an average daily turnover of HK$54 billion, 23% lower than in 2011. U.S. Federal Reserve sparked a final quarter rally for equities globally when they announced a third round of quantitative easing. The Hang Seng Index finished the year 23% higher, while the S&P 500 closed the year up 13.4% and the Shanghai- Shenzhen CSI300 Index was plus (685.6) (773.8) Cost to income (% Revenue) (8.5) (9.0) (66.6) (21.0) Exchange gain (43.7) Wealth Management and Brokerage segment covers securities, structured products, futures, options, commodities, foreign exchange, discretionary portfolio management services, mutual funds, insurance, and Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) advisory. A platform under SHK Direct, “SHKF eMo!”, is also available for customers who prefer to conduct trades on a “DIY” basis. Sun Hung Kai Financial’s total client assets under advice/custody or management amount to over HK$63 billion. The Company’s margin loan book was over HK$3 billion at the end of 2012. Sun Hung Kai & Co. Limited Annual Report 2012 Turnover in this segment of the business declined by 26% during 2012. Interest income declined by 35%; brokerage and commission revenue declined by 18%. Pre-tax contribution to the Group declined by 65% to HK$111.4 million. Despite the difficulties of 2012, our efforts to transform Sun Hung Kai Financial into a wealth management firm has helped cushion the decline in commission. Offering an open and one-stop investment platform should allow us to benefit from more stable and long term customer relationships that provide revenue streams less correlated to the stock market. To this end, our efforts in product and service innovation achieved some positive results in 2012. Product development and research have been strengthened significantly. New customer segments were enhanced through CIES services as well as our SHK Private platform targeting high net worth customers. Our asset management division was also integrated into this segment, allowing for the development of more products suited to our wealth management customers, including discretionary portfolio management products. Total commission revenue from wealth management products (such as structured products, funds, insurance linked assurance schemes, and bonds) increased by 68% during 2012, accounting for 36% of overall commission in this segment. Commission from brokerage products (including Hong Kong shares, options, futures, commodities and bullion) declined by 36% reflecting lower volumes as well as competitive market pressures. The Group’s focus is on bottom line profitability, so market share is not its top priority. Nonetheless, given its leading position and low cost structure, the Group should benefit from any recovery in market sentiment and volumes. Encouragingly, momentum in the business has picked up since the last quarter of 2012. For the first two months of 2013, Hong Kong’s average daily stock turnover was HK$75 billion, which is higher than the HK$54 billion average for 2012. Enhancements have been made in the past two years to strengthen SHK Direct, our trading platform for “DIY” clients, with the introduction of our mobile trading app, SHKF eMO!. In our experience, this special group of customers tends to increase their trading when there is a recovery in sentiment. The Group scaled back its margin loan book in 2012. Although demand for funding remained robust, we adopted a more conservative approach towards the writing of new loans in view of a less favourable risk/return metric. At the end of 2012, our net margin loan balance was HK$3,286.7 million, in 2011. As a result, interest income in this segment also declined by 35%. Bad debts of HK$66.6 million also impacted profitability. on financial instruments in 2012 reflecting mark to market valuation adjustments from our strategic investments with our asset management business partners. These investments are classified under “Equity securities in unlisted investment funds” in our financial statements. (97.6) (87.2) Cost to income (% Revenue) (0.2) (76.3) (1.3) (0.6) (94.3) The uncertain market environment made 2012 a challenging year for corporate finance. Compared to 2011, total IPO funds raised in Hong Kong capital markets in 2012 tumbled 65% from approximately HK$260 billion to HK$90 billion. The total number of newly listed companies including listing board transfers from the Growth Enterprise Market to the Main Board also declined significantly from 101 in 2011 to 64 in 2012. In this environment, the segment’s non-interest income declined. However, a HK$82.6 million net profit on financial instruments was recorded. In 2011, we booked a net loss of HK$94.3 million from unrealised mark to market losses on underwriting positions. Those positions were subsequently disposed of during 2012 and losses have been reversed. In 2012, we took part in 12 IPO- related underwriting transactions, three secondary fundraising exercises and four financial advisory-related transactions, all of which were successfully completed. We are more optimistic about the market in 2013 and are buoyed by the Group’s drive to tap into mid-to-small cap sectors, with increased resources devoted to underwriting and financial advisory- related transactions. The performance of the Group’s Capital Markets division has largely mirrored market conditions. Revenue was HK$235.3 million, a decline of 28% from 2011, and contribution to pre-tax profit was HK$142.8 million, a 4% decline. During the year, the Group has continued to strengthen its capabilities in Hong Kong and Mainland China mid-to-small cap corporate segments. The Capital Markets segment services the Group’s corporate and institutional clients. It covers corporate finance, structured lending, equity capital markets, and corporate and institutional sales business, offering equity and debt fund raising solutions for our clients. Sun Hung Kai & Co. Limited Annual Report 2012 Our unique “debt plus equity” one-stop-shop funding model achieved positive results in 2012, despite the weak equity market. We also saw strong demand from our corporate customers for debt financing throughout the year, and in the last quarter of 2012 a number of new loans were written. As a result our structured finance business grew significantly. As of 31 December 2012, the Group’s net secured term loans balance increased to HK$1,736.9 million, compared with HK$964.8 million at Finance segment increased by 24% and its contribution to earnings before tax increased by 34% to HK$1,147.5 million. the end of 2011. This did not reflect in interest income for 2012, which declined 15% to HK$181.5 million, as a majority of new loans were written towards the end of the year. Bad debts of HK$76.3 million were recorded, impacting profitability. This impairment loss was an isolated case and we remain positive on the general prospects for the loan business. In January 2013, we announced a HK$600 million loan transaction with Asia Financial Services Company Limited (details of which are disclosed in the Circular dated 23 January 2013), which will be added to the loan balance in 2013. In our structured finance portfolio, certain loans have equity- linked components related to Mainland China based investment projects with an IPO exit target of 24 months. These should bring potential for capital gains for the Group, as well as future business for our corporate finance unit. We are actively seeking further opportunities along this strategy. UAF delivered a record profit in 2012.

UAF started operations in Mainland China in 2007 and its aggregate loan balance in the country now accounts for 30% of UAF’s total. UAF has built a branch network of 125 outlets across Hong Kong and nine major cities in Mainland China. UAF’s total loan book is about HK$8.3 billion, 10% higher than at the end of 2011. Revenue grew faster than the total of loan balances during 2012, reflecting an increasing proportion of business from Mainland China that has a higher gross return than the Hong Kong business. In Hong Kong, yields have also improved slightly overall. a. Amounts directly deducted from impairment allowance (“write off”) (366.7) (273.3) (53.2) Total bad and doubtful debt charges (350.8) (164.5) The segment’s earnings benefited from the finalisation of the costs associated with the Group’s acquisition of UAF in 2006. The amortisation of intangible assets largely ended in 2012. The interest expense incurred from associated loans also declined as these loans were repaid in full during the course of the year. By category Change from 2011 The total impairment charge on bad and doubtful debts which was an amount equal to the net sum of bad debts written off, charges or releases to/from impairment allowances and bad debts recovered increased to HK$350.8 million (2011: HK$164.5 million). The increase was caused by a rise in bad debts written off net of recovery during the year, and the absence of release in impairment allowance recorded in 2011. The charge-off ratio of bad debts written off net of recovery (as a % of year end gross loan balance) was 3.4% as against 2.8% in 2011. UAF’s Mainland China business dominated its growth profile as the gross principal balance in Mainland China increased by 69% during 2012, accounting for 30% (2011: 20%) of UAF’s total. UAF will continue to expand in Mainland China with new branches and loan products. During 2012 UAF added a further 26 new branches to its network, of which 25 new branches were opened in Mainland China. UAF’s revenue in Mainland China increased by 72% along with rising profitability. Sun Hung Kai & Co. Limited Annual Report 2012 UAF’S BRANCH NETWORK AS OF 31.12.2012 New branches in 2012 At the end of 2012, money lending licenses in Shanghai, Fuzhou and Harbin were also granted to UAF, and operations have commenced in the first quarter of 2013. UAF will continue to pursue further money lending licenses in cities that show growth potential. A new property mortgage loan business had its launch in Beijing and Wuhan in late 2012. UAF will monitor this product with a view to launching it in other cities in China in 2013. Feasibility studies on new loan products are always active on UAF’s agenda and new products will be launched once market and regulatory conditions allow. UAF’s objective is to maintain growth momentum close to that of 2012. This loan growth can be comfortably funded given the Group’s strong financial position. To date, more than HK$4 billion has been committed as paid up capital in various Mainland cities. Loan balances in Hong Kong dropped slightly due to the competitive environment in personal loan markets and slower growth in mortgages as investors in the property market became more cautious. However, revenue from Hong Kong operations increased by 7% as more loans were granted at higher interest rates. UAF successfully launched a new “No Show Loan” in 2012, featuring a more efficient service meeting customer appetite for a reduction in loan documentation requirements. UAF will continue to innovate with its loan products to cater to market demand. Hiring a diverse range of sales personnel will reinforce our reach to more customer segments. Also in the pipeline are further advertising campaigns to promote the loan businesses. Our management will make every endeavour to use its leadership position in the market and increase the profit for the years ahead. The Group’s capital has been invested in a variety of businesses and transactions, including small and medium enterprises in Mainland China, utilities, and private equity investments. The Group’s major fixed assets and investments include office space previously occupied by Sun Hung Kai Financial in Admiralty Centre, where 27,000 out of 32,000 square feet saleable area is classified as investment property. We manage a portfolio of listed and un-listed investments to create synergies and business opportunities with the other segments of the Group. Principal Investments contributed HK$298.6 million to the Group’s pre-tax profit, an increase from HK$295.1 million of 2011. In 2012, the Group has recorded a HK$63.7 million (2011: HK$5.7 million) profit from financial instruments in its investment portfolio. Our strategy for this portfolio is to identify investments with attractive returns and provide synergies with other business divisions of the Group. In 2012, we completed the disposal of legacy hotel investments in Malaysia and the Philippines, resulting in a total profit of HK$96.4 million shown under Other Income. An increase in the fair value of our investment properties also contributed HK$41.5 million (2011: HK$192.6 million). Sun Hung Kai Financial and UAF faced difficult market conditions in 2012. Looking ahead to 2013, we anticipate somewhat more positive market conditions for both sides of the business. With regard to UAF, the Group will continue prudent expansion in Mainland China consumer finance, with a view to developing it as a major contributor to profits in the future. Prospects for the Sun Hung Kai Financial business have improved with the European sovereign debt crisis more stable for the moment, and some continuing improvement in U.S. financial indicators. There were also signs of increased economic activity in Mainland China towards the end of 2012, though the trend in asset prices is becoming a concern. Hopefully, these developments will lead to increased activity in financial markets and a recovery in our fee generating businesses as well as growth in our loan books. Despite this more optimistic outlook, we will maintain a prudent oversight of our cost structure.

Strong Risk Management The Group adopts a comprehensive risk management framework. Risk management policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to react to changes of market conditions and the Group’s business strategy. The Risk Management Committee, a standing committee reporting to the Board of Directors, supervises and scrutinises risk-related policies necessary for monitoring and controlling of the major risks, spelt out here, arising from the Group’s business activities, external changing risks and regulatory environment. The Group’s financial risk management seeks to manage market risk (risk that the value of an investment will change due to movements in market factors; comprised of equity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange or currency risk), credit risk (risk of losses arising from clients or counterparties fail to make payments as contracted) and liquidity risk (risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded readily in the market to prevent a loss or make the required profit). These are further discussed and outlined in Note 54 to the consolidated financial statements. Operational risk is defined as the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. The Group extends operational risk to cover potential losses arising from legal and compliance breaches. Operational risk is reduced and controlled through establishing robust internal controls, clear lines of responsibility, proper segregation of duties and effective internal reporting and contingency planning. It is our corporate culture that the business and operating line management are fully aware of and responsible for managing operational risks of their business units on a day-to-day basis. There are independent monitoring and reviews conducted by Compliance and Internal Audit which report regularly to the Group’s senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board. Reputational risk is the risk related to the trustworthiness of a business. Loss of trust can result in declines in the customer base, revenue erosion, costly litigation and destruction of shareholder value and damage to the Company’s reputation as a whole. The Group manages reputational risk through sound corporate governance practices. Group employees and sales personnel are provided with comprehensive training. Operating procedures manuals are regularly updated. The responsibilities and duties of staff are properly segregated. The internal control functions report directly to the Group’s senior management.

Funeral business in the PRC continues to be the driving force of the Group’s operations. The Group’s turnover derived from funeral business in the PRC market for the year ended 31 December 2012 was approximately RMB56.5 million, representing an increase of about 8.5% to the corresponding period last year and accounted for about 91.4% of the Group’s turnover. During 20 to 22 November 2012, the Group participated in the “5th China International Funeral Expo 2012” held in Wuhan City. Through this expo, the Group presented its high quality and professional services to industry counterparts in China, and thus laying a good foundation for the Group’s future expansion into other service regions in China. This had significantly enhanced the opportunities in business co-operation with industry counterparts. The Group’s funeral business in the Hong Kong market showed promising and sustainable signs of growth with an approximate turnover of RMB1.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 representing a substantial increase of about 726.6% to the corresponding period last year and accounted for approximately 2.9% of the Group’s turnover. The Group’s turnover derived from funeral business in the Taiwan market for the year ended 31 December 2012 was approximately RMB3.5 million, representing a decrease of approximately 40.7% to the corresponding period last year and accounted for approximately 5.7% of the Group’s turnover. In light of this decreasing scope of business in Taiwan, the Group will consider directing resources to other markets with higher revenue growth potentials. The Group’s turnover derived from raw marble wholesale business market for the year ended 31 December 2012 was approximately RMB0.01 million, representing a notable decrease of 99.9% to the corresponding period last year and accounted for an insignificant amount of the Group’s turnover. It is anticipated that the global economic environment will continue to have an adverse effect on the raw marble wholesale business of the Group. In anticipation of the circumstances surrounding the raw marble wholesale business, the Group will exercise diligent discretion and seek applicable recourse in operating this business unit in the forthcoming period. Looking ahead, apart from the funeral business in the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the Group is also committed to exploring the funeral business outside the Greater China region. On 6 December 2012, the Group entered into a share transfer contract to prepare for the acquisition of the 80% equity interest of a Vietnamese company which has acquired the land use right of a piece of land in Vietnam, which is formally designated for use as cemetery in the categorization of land for different uses by the Vietnamese government and the expected total investment amounted to VND40,000,000,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB12,000,000). On the other hand, the Group entered into a management and construction technical support contract (the “Support Contract”) on 4 January 2013, and the Group will be mainly responsible for supporting the overall planning and design of a cemetery park located in Beijing as well as the technical and financial support for the construction of cemetery and tombstone under the contract. The Group will entitle to share 63% of the profit therein. Furthermore, on 12 January 2013, the Group entered into an agreement (“Cooperation Agreement”) with an , and the Group will be mainly responsible for the market research and development and provision of technical staff and equipment required for its operation. The Group will be entitled to 70% of the pre- tax turnover to be generated from the Cooperation Agreement. The term of the Cooperation Agreement is 3 years. After the end of the Cooperation Agreement, the Group has the right to automatically extend the Cooperation Agreement for five years. The PRC and Hong Kong will continue to be the Group’s key development regions, and Vietnam will also become another region with huge development potential for the Group in the coming year. The management of the Group will continue to apply its professional and distinctive business model effectively in different regions, and simultaneously envisage other regions with huge potential and opportunities, thereby expanding our business coverage. The turnover arising from principal activities for the year ended 31 December 2012 was approximately RMB61.8 million (2011: approximately RMB72.5 million), representing a decrease of approximately 14.8% as compared to 2011. The decrease in turnover is mainly attributed to the Group’s business of raw marble wholesale and the diminishing of sales in the Taiwan market due to strengthened competition. Regarding to the funeral services business provided in the PRC during the year, the turnover was approximately RMB56.5 million (2011: approximately RMB52.1 million), representing an increase of approximately 8.5% which accounted for 91.4% of the Group’s turnover (2011: 71.9%). The turnover generated by the funeral services business provided in Taiwan was approximately RMB3.5 million (2011: approximately RMB5.9 million), or 5.7% of the Group’s turnover, representing a decrease of approximately 40.7% due to strengthened competition in Taiwan. The turnover generated by the funeral services business provided in Hong Kong was approximately RMB1.8 million (2011: approximately RMB0.2 million), or 2.9% of the Group’s turnover, representing an increase of approximately 726.6%. The turnover from the funeral service provided in funeral parlour and funeral service centres under the Group’s management increased by 9.5%, amounting to approximately RMB42.7 million (2011: approximately RMB39.0 million). The rise was mainly due to the increase in the number of funeral services provided from 2,601 for 2011 to 2,996 for 2012. However, the average spending per service provided slightly decrease to approximately RMB14,259 for 2012 (2011: approximately RMB14,987) which resulted from cessation of the management of the operation of An Fu Tang which average spending per service provided is higher than the overall average spending. The turnover from the cremation services increased by 5.6%, amounting to approximately RMB11.3 million (2011: approximately RMB10.7 million). The increase was due to the increase in the average spending per service provided from approximately RMB1,261 for 2011 to approximately RMB1,381. However, there was slightly decrease in the number of cremation services provided from 8,454 for 2011 to 8,207 for 2012. Under the funeral parlour management agreement and funeral service centre management agreements, the Group is entitled to all income and responsible for all liabilities and all expenses incurred in the funeral parlour and funeral service centres under the Group’s management. The revenue generated from funeral arrangement services provided in Taiwan and Hong Kong was approximately RMB3.5 million and RMB1.8 million respectively (2011: approximately RMB5.9 million and RMB0.2 million), representing a decline of 40.7% and increase of 726.6% respectively over last year. The decline in Taiwan business was due to the intense competition in the Taiwan funeral service industry and the Directors believe that the market in Taiwan is saturated and room for growth is limited. Thus, the number of cases for the funeral arrangement services provided in Taiwan dropped in 2012 and resulted in the decrease in the total turnover here. Gross profit slightly increase by 1.5% to approximately RMB46.3 million (2011: approximately RMB45.6 million), and gross profit margin increased to approximately 74.9% (2011: approximately 62.9%). The gross profit margin of funeral services provided in funeral parlour and funeral service centres under the Group’s management increased to approximately 77.6% (2011: approximately 74.8%) which was mainly due to the increase in the turnover from the funeral service provided which reduce the cost sharing of each funeral service. The gross profit margin of cremation services slightly decreased to approximately 83.4% (2011: approximately 85.9%) which was mainly due to the net effect of increase in average spending per service by 9.5% and increase in fuel cost for cremation and that of funeral arrangement services decreased to approximately 33.8% (2011: approximately 40.6%). The Group’s cost of sales primarily consists of costs directly attributable to the provision of its services, which mainly include (i) direct labour for the funeral services provided by individuals during the funeral ceremony held in a funeral parlour or a funeral service centre managed by the Group; (ii) subcontracting charges for services provided by the subcontractors in Taiwan; (iii) commission expenses from the recognition of commission paid to sales agents for funeral services deeds at the point when the services of the funeral services deeds are provided; and (iv) materials used for funeral ceremonies and cremation services such as fresh flowers, fuel for the cremation furnace and cost of the goods sold in the funeral parlour and funeral service centres under the Group’s management in the PRC. Selling expenses decreased by approximately 6.0% to approximately RMB25.1 million (2011: approximately RMB26.7 million). The decrease was mainly attributable to net effect of the Group’s decreased rental and management costs due to the cessation of the management of the operation of An Fu Tang and increase in agency costs resulting from the increase in the turnover from funeral services provided in funeral parlours and funeral service centres under the Group’s management. The proportion of selling expenses to turnover was approximately 40.6% (2011: approximately 36.8%). Administrative expenses rose by approximately 2.3% to approximately RMB44.1 million (2011: approximately RMB43.1 million) as a result of the continuous expansion of the Group’s PRC business which had increased the depreciation and amortisation resulting from the increase in investment in the property, plant and equipment in the PRC; and the preliminary expenses incurred for the expansion of new business location in the PRC and Vietnam. The proportion of administrative expenses to turnover was approximately 71.4% (2011: approximately 59.5%). Finance costs remained nearly the same of approximately RMB0.2 million (2011: approximately RMB0.3 million) because of the decline in bank interest rates. Income tax expense decreased by approximately 33.3% to approximately RMB1.2 million (2011: approximately RMB1.8 million). In 2012, loss attributable to owners of the Company for the year was approximately RMB29.5 million (2011: approximately RMB30.1 million). The decrease in loss for the year ended 31 December 2012 was mainly due to the net effect of (i) increase in the gross profit; (ii) increase in other revenue and other net gain as there was an increase in value of financial assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss and (iii) increase in other operating expenses. The Group maintains a stable financial position. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had bank balances and cash of approximately RMB177.6 million (2011: approximately RMB194.2 million) and bank and other loan and obligation under finance lease of approximately RMB20.5 million (2011: approximately RMB10.9 million). Approximately RMB10.1 million and RMB10.4 million of bank and other loan were denominated in United States Dollars and New Taiwan Dollars respectively, at prevailing market interest. During the year, the Group did not use any financial instruments for hedging purposes. The gearing ratio representing the ratio of total borrowing to the total assets of the Group was 5.9% as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 2.9%). During the year, the Group’s major operations were geographically based in the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The revenue derived from Taiwan and Hong Kong accounted for approximately 8.5% (2011: approximately 21.9%) of the total revenue. Its financial statements are presented in Renminbi, while a significant portion of the revenue and expenses are denominated in the United States Dollar, New Taiwan Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. It is possible that the value of Renminbi may fluctuate in value against that of the United States Dollar, New Taiwan Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. The Group’s operating results and financial condition may be affected by changes in the exchange rates of Renminbi against the United States Dollar, New Taiwan Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar, in which the Group’s revenue and expenses are denominated. As at 31 December 2012, the Group did not have any bank liabilities, foreign exchange contracts, interest or currency swaps or other financial derivatives for hedging purpose. Therefore, the Group is not exposed to any material interest and exchange risks.

Remuneration packages including performance bonuses and entitlements to share options are reviewed on regular basis.

An analysis comparing the business objectives as stated in the Prospectus with the Group’s actual business progress for the period from 9 September 2009 (the “Listing Date”) to 31 December 2012 is set out below: Expand funeral services network in other major cities by entering into funeral- The Group has implemented two memoranda of understanding (the “MOU”) disclosed in the “Future Plan and Prospects” section of the Prospectus. The Group is in the process of negotiating the terms with the owners of remaining funeral parlours and new funeral service centres. The Group has also signed two other new subcontracting agreements during 2010. Develop business in columbarium in As disclosed in the announcement by the Company on 5 January 2011, the register for the owner of the columbarium was changed. At present, the new owner is still negotiating with Bau Shan Life Science Technology Co., Ltd. (“Bau Shan”), the direct subsidiary of the Company, as to the continuance of the agency agreement to sell cubicles and space for urn storage in the columbarium (the “Products”) in Miaoli County in Taiwan or the sale of the columbarium (and the Products) to Bau Shan. Purchase of funeral service equipment The Group is conducting the feasibility study on advanced equipment and facilities designated for funeral. On 24 November 2011, the Group entered into a shareholders agreement with a Japanese-invested enterprise for the plan of bringing funeral related products, services and technologies from Japan. Refurbishment of new and existing The Group has started the decoration and improvement of funeral parlours and services centres under its managements. The Group has started the establishment of the website and organised and sponsored a forum and research on the funeral industry. The business objectives and planned use of proceeds as stated in the Prospectus were based on the best estimation of future market conditions made by the Group at the time of preparing the Prospectus while the proceeds were applied in accordance with the actual development of the market. During the period from the Listing Date to 31 December 2012, the net proceeds from issuance of new shares of the Company had been applied as follows: Expand funeral services network in other major cities The Group had to renegotiate several terms and conditions with the owners of the funeral parlours and new funeral service centres under the MOUs and the owner of columbarium in Taiwan. Due to the above reasons and certain expansion activities were postponed, the net proceeds applied during the period from the Listing Date to 31 December 2012 are less than expected. The Directors expect that most of the business objectives stated in the Prospectus for the period from the Listing Date to 31 December 2012 will be revisited in the first half of 2013. All the remaining proceeds as at 31 December 2012 have been placed as interest bearing deposits in banks.

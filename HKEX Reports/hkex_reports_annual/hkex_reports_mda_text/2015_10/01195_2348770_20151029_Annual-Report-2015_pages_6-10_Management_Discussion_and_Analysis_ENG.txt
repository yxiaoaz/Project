For the Year, revenue of the Group from continuing operations amounted to approximately RMB9,412,000 (2014: RMB27,086,000), representing a decrease of approximately 65.3% as comparing with last year. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the decrease in the sales of property development business. During the Year, the Group recorded a gross profit from continuing operations of approximately RMB2,546,000 (2014: gross profit of RMB6,536,000) and loss before tax from continuing operations of approximately RMB55,173,000 (2014: loss before tax of RMB48,873,000), respectively. The decrease in gross profit and increase in loss before tax were mainly due to the smaller revenue contribution from the property development business, and the increase in administrative expenses, other expenses and finance costs during the Year. The profit attributable to owners of the Company for the Year was approximately RMB20,922,000 (2014: loss of RMB101,101,000). The profit attributable to owners of the Company for the Year was mainly contributed from a discontinued operation. Basic earnings per share for the Year was RMB0.94 cent (2014: basic loss per share was RMB4.91 cents). The Company acquired 51% equity interest in a gold mining company in Russian Federation and completed the acquisition on 15 August 2012. The gold mining company is a company established under the laws of Russian Federation with limited liability and currently operates and owns the legal and beneficial interest in a mining project related to the mine. With an aggregate mining area of about 309.3 square kilometres, the mine is operated by the gold mining company and located in Molchan river, Zeyskiy region, Amur area, the Russian Federation. The mine is estimated to have sand gold reserve of 35 tonnes (C1 category). The gold mining company is still in process of devising its production and exploitation plan. On 30 January 2015, the Company acquired a 35% equity interest of Port First. Major assets of Port First are its 70% equity interest in each of Jinxin Company and Jinhui Company. Jinxin Company (i) holds the mine exploitation license and mine exploration license of the Shanchakou Mine; (ii) holds the mine exploitation license of Jinjiling Area; and (iii) owns a gold processing plant and a gold refinery plant. Jinhui Company holds the mine exploitation license and mine exploration license of the Yaojia Mine. During the Year, the average selling price of gold was under great downward pressure which undermined the profitability of the gold mining business. The gold mining business has valid licenses, environmental protection policies and permits for conducting its business operations and has complied with relevant local requirements and applicable laws and regulations for its business operations. The principal risk and uncertainties of the gold mining business are (i) fluctuation of gold prices, which will direct effect the sale performance; and (ii) social and environmental issues, any complaints or protests by the local community, and change of the environmental regulation or requirement will direct effect the efficiency and the cost of the operation. During the Year, the gold mining segment recorded a loss of RMB9,567,000 as compared to a loss of RMB1,721,000 in last year. As at 30 June 2015, the gold mining business had segment assets of RMB231,145,000 (2014: RMB147,048,000) and segment liabilities of RMB101,000 (2014: RMB182,000). The property development project “Anlu Taihe Paradise” at Liang Ji Bei Road, Anlu Economic Development District in Anlu city, Hubei province in the PRC is wholly owned by the Group and is having positive contribution to the Group. The project comprises three phases, with a total gross floor area of approximately 272,568 square meters and are approved for residential and commercial composite uses. The land use rights of the properties have been granted for a term expiring on 22 August 2065. In which, some of properties are held by the Group as investment purposes (as shops, kindergarten and hotel) to generate the rental income, and some of the properties are held for sale. The properties held for sales comprise various types of properties including villas and apartments. During the Year, the PRC property market condition had made challenges to the property development business. The property sales situations and average selling prices were still under great pressure and undermined the profitability of the property development business. The property development business has valid licenses and permits for conducting its business operation, and has complied with relevant local requirements and applicable laws and regulations for its business. The principal risk and uncertainties of the property development business are (i) economic conditions, both domestic and global issues will direct effect the sale performance; and (ii) government policy change, any change of the PRC government policies over the property industry in China will direct effect the sale performance and the cost of operation. During the Year, the property development segment recorded a profit of RMB14,933,000 as compared to a profit of approximately RMB617,000 in last year. As at 30 June 2015, the property development business had segment assets of RMB158,861,000 (2014: RMB147,398,000) and segment liabilities of RMB49,717,000 (2014: RMB49,667,000). During the Year, unfavourable market condition in the global economy continued to pose various challenges to the electronic industry. Both the Group’s orders and average selling prices were under pressure and amid intense market competition. The rise of raw material and labour costs, shortage of labour force and environmental protection requirements increased the production costs and undermined the profitability of the electronic business. After the disposal of the electronic business, the Group ceased to be engaged in the electronic business which mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale of rigid printed circuit boards (the “RPCBs”). During the Year, the discontinued operation of the electronic business contributed a profit of approximately RMB73,842,000 (2014: loss of RMB51,999,000). Revenue from continuing operations of RMB9,412,000 (2014: RMB27,086,000) was derived from sales to external customers located in Mainland China. In order to sustain the continuous growth of the Group and meet the coming challenges, the Group successfully developed its property development business in Anlu city, Hubei province in the PRC. The real estate project, comprising various types of properties including villas, apartments and commercial buildings, had made positive contribution to the Group in the past. We expect that the property development business will provide positive contribution in the coming year. In August 2012, the Group acquired a gold mining company in the Russian Federation. On 30 January 2015, the Company acquired a 35% equity interest of Port First. Major assets of Port First are its 70% equity interest in each of Jinxin Company and Jinhui Company. Jinxin Company (i) holds the mine exploitation license and mine exploration license of the Shanchakou Mine; (ii) holds the mine exploitation license of Jinjiling Area; and (iii) owns a gold processing plant and a gold refinery plant. Jinhui Company holds the mine exploitation license and mine exploration license of the Yaojia Mine. Considering China’s strong demand and sustainable growth in the gold market, the Directors expect the future business and prospect of Port First and its subsidiaries will contribute to generate profit stream to the Group. The Directors consider that the acquisition represents an opportunity for the Group to further develop its current gold mining business and increase the Group’s gold resources. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to implement its diversified development strategy and proactively search for potential investment opportunities.

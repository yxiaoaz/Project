The gross profit margins by categories of works performed are set out below: The gross profit margin for waterworks engineering service dropped to 7.8% for the Reporting Year (2018: 19.6%).

The gross profit margin for road works and drainage and site formation works service increased to 12.0% for the Reporting Year (2018: 3.2%). Such increase was mainly attributable to the substantial completion and additional payments received for the contract KL/2012/03 during the Reporting Year, which contributed to the Group a comparatively higher gross profit margin for the year ended 31 March 2019. The gross profit margin for the LPM Service decreased significantly to 0.1% for the Reporting Year (2018: 62.1%). Such decrease was mainly due to the one-off recognition of the payments received as revenue upon completion of the projects GE/2010/21, GE/2012/11, GE/2013/06 and GE/2013/17 in the last year, while the project GE/2013/16 has substantially completed and additional payments has been received in the Reporting Year.

The Group’s major bank balances are deposited with banks with good reputation and hence the management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these banks. In relation to the management of liquidity risk, the Group’s policy is to regularly monitor the liquidity requirements in order to maintain sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major banks to meet the liquidity requirements in short and long term. The Group mainly operates in Hong Kong, Philippines and Thailand with most of the transactions originally denominated in the respective local currency. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised financial assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. As at 31 March 2019, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk from various currencies, primarily with respect to Philippine peso (“PHP”) and Thai baht (“THB”). Except for performance deposits for construction projects and certain receivables denominated in THB and PHP, which is approximately HK$118.0 million and HK$29.6 million respectively, the Group will not be exposed to any other significant exchange risk.

Remuneration of the employees is determined with reference to market terms and the performance, qualification and experience of individual employees. In addition to a basic salary, year-end discretionary bonuses are offered to those staff with outstanding performance to attract and retain eligible employees to contribute to the Group. The Group has adopted a share option scheme pursuant to which the Company may grant options to individuals including employees, adviser, consultant, service provider, agent, customer, partner or joint-venture partner of the Company and any subsidiary to acquire shares of the Company. The Directors consider that the share option scheme assists in recruiting and retaining high calibre employees. As at 31 March 2019, the Group was involved in certain litigations. In the opinion of the Directors, based on the advice of the Group’s legal counsels, the possibility of any outflow of resources in settling these claims was remote and/or sufficient insurance policies are maintained to cover the loss, if any, and therefore the ultimate liability under these claims would not have a material adverse impact on the financial position or results of the Group.

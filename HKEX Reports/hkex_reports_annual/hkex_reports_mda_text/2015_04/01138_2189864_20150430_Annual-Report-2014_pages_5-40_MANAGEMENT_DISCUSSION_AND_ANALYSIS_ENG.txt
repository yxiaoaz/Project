CHINA SHIPPING DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED Annual Report 2014 In 2014, global economy recovered at a slow pace, Chinese economic growth slowed down, and the demand from shipping market was weak. On the other hand, due to increasing shipping capacity, the condition of capacity oversupply has not achieved substantial improvement, and the international shipping market was still sluggish. In 2014, world economy recovered at a pace which was weaker than expected in the beginning of the year, resulting in lower expected growth in global oil demand. According to statistics of the International Energy Agency, the incremental oil demand in 2014 was 670 thousand barrels/day, representing the lowest level in the past five years. On the other hand, due to increasing supply of shipping capacity, the issue of capacity oversupply has not been significantly improved and the oil shipping market continued a downturn trend. In 2014, performance of international oil shipping market in general was better as compared to the same period in 2013. The annual average value of freight index for three typical routes in the very large crude oil carrier (“VLCC”) market (Middle East - Far East, Middle East - the US and the Gulf, West Africa - China) rose by 12% year-on-year, while the annual average value of freight index for three typical routes (Middle East – Japan TCI, Middle East - Japan TC5, Singapore - Japan TC4) for three types of vessels (LR2, LR1, MR) in the international clean oil market rose by 7.8%, rose by 1.5% and fell by 17% year-on-year respectively. Meanwhile, international oil shipping market was volatile, with the highest and the lowest values of freight index for route from Middle East to Far East in the VLCC market reaching 80 points and 32 points respectively, and the time interval for the highest point was very short, which exerted huge pressure on business operations. For domestic oil shipment, due to reduced supply from long route offshore crude oil shipment, domestic crude oil shipping market became increasingly competitive which led to declined revenue. Meanwhile, as a result of factors such as more balanced distribution of refineries, rapid development of pipelines transportation and localised purchase and sale by petrochemical enterprises, shipping market for domestic refined oil continued to shrink with significant decrease in both volumes and prices. Since early 2014, investment growth rate kept declining against a backdrop of global economic slowdown, leading to decreasing commodity prices and shrinking demand for international dry bulk shipment. Affected by weak market demand and continuous high level of supplied capacity, international dry bulk cargo shipment continued to decline, with annual average value of Baltic Dry Index of 1,105 points, representing a decrease of 9.2% as compared to 2013. For coastal dry bulk shipping market, affected by China’s economic restructuring, decreased domestic demand for thermal power, inadequate demand in coastal bulk shipping market and continuous oversupply of capacity, freight rates for coastal dry bulk cargoes continued to decline, with Coastal Bulk Freight Index, an integrated freight rate index for coastal dry bulk shipment, falling from 1,239 points in the beginning of the year to 901 points at the end of the year, which was the lowest point since the index was released in 2001. The annual average value was 990 points, representing a decrease of 12.1% as compared to 2013. Facing the complicated market environment, the Group continued to deepen the strategy of “major clients, great co-operation and comprehensive services” under the right leadership of the Board, and actively innovated business ideas and models, obtaining new breakthroughs and achievements in various areas such as management improvement, marketing, reducing cost and increasing efficiency as well as safety management, significantly improving the operating conditions of the Company and maintaining our overall stable development trend. In 2014, the volume of cargoes shipped by the Group was 182 million tonnes, dropped by 1.9% year-on-year; transport turnover were 430.1 billion tonne-nautical miles, increased by 10.9% year-on-year; revenue derived from operations (after business tax and surcharge) was RMB12.274 billion, increased by 8.2% year-on-year; operating cost was RMB10.886 billion, dropped by 5.5% year-on-year. The profit attributable to owners of the Company was RMB309 million and the basic earnings per share for 2014 was RMB9.09 cents. In 2014, overall details of the Group’s principal operations by products transported and geographical regions were as follows: Increase/ (decrease) with 2013 Increase/ (decrease) with 2013 Increase/ (decrease) with 2013 CHINA SHIPPING DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED Annual Report 2014 Increase/ (decrease) to 2013 In 2014, in adherence to the “major clients and great co-operation” strategy, China Shipping Tanker Co., Limited (“China Shipping Tanker”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company actively innovated operation ideas and business models, with continuous improvement in transportation efficiency and remarkable achievement in cost efficiency. For domestic oil shipment, the Company actively innovated the model of cooperation with shippers, significantly improving the shipping efficiency and effectiveness of the domestic oil shipment fleet. In 2014, with the great support of China Shipping, our controlling shareholder, the Company actively carried out integration of tanker assets, and through China Shipping Tanker completed the acquisition of 20% and 20% equity interest in Shanghai Beihai Shipping Company Limited (“Beihai Shipping”) from Sinochem International Corporation and Shanghai Shipping (Group) Company respectively. Seizing the opportunities of capital injection into Beihai Shipping, the Company actively promoted all-round cooperation with China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Beihai Shipping. In 2014, domestic offshore oil of the Company recorded a year-on-year growth rate of 9.7% and gross profit of RMB500 million despite a year-on-year decrease in revenue of 6%. In 2014, the Company recorded gross profit for domestic crude oil shipment of RMB660 million and continued to maintain its leading position (about 52% market share) in domestic crude oil shipping market. Meanwhile, in the face of rapid downturn of domestic refined oil market in recent years, particularly the structural shrinkage of market for big vessels over ten thousand tonnes, the Company adopted a strategic exit strategy while exploiting the complementary strengths in the domestic and foreign markets to timely adjust allocation of domestic and foreign oil shipment capacities, hence the gross profit from domestic refined oil shipment increased by approximately RMB60 million despite the decrease in revenue of RMB83 million. For international oil shipment, the Company significantly optimized the cargo-owner structure, market structure and route structure through active promotion of diversification strategy; and continued to optimise speed with the best economic benefit by strengthened analysis of budget and final accounts of voyage. In 2014, the Company increased investment in the West African routes and third-country shipment, with the proportion of revenue from West African routes increased to 30% this year from 7.5% last year, while the proportion of third-country shipment increase to 22% this year from 7.5% last year, thereby reducing reliance of VLCC fleet on the Middle East - Far East routes. As a result, the consolidated income and risk resistant ability of VLCC fleet have improved significantly with operating efficiency significantly better than the market level. In 2014, the Company’s VLCC fleet recorded gross profit of RMB102 million, significantly reducing loss of RMB759 million as compared to 2013. In 2014, the Group achieved a shipping volume of approximately 190.5 billion tonne-nautical miles of oil, representing an increase of approximately 2.4% year-on-year; revenue derived from oil transportation was approximately RMB550 million, representing an increase of 2.1% year-on-year. An analysis of the transportation volume and revenue in terms of product types is as follows: In 2014 In 2013 Increase/ (billion tonne- (billion tonne- nautical miles) nautical miles) CHINA SHIPPING DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED Annual Report 2014 In 2014 In 2013 Increase/ (RMB million) (RMB million) For domestic bulk cargo shipment, in 2014, China Shipping Bulk Carrier Co., Limited (“CS Bulk”) strengthened marketing on domestic big customers by advanced arrangement of COA contract negotiations early in the year, and strived to increase the fulfilment rate of the contracts. In 2014, CS Bulk signed COA contracts for domestic dry bulk cargoes with a shipping volume of 56.5 million tonnes. Meanwhile, it actively innovated the pricing model of contracts through various pricing models such as fixed freight rates and index linked pricing according to the wishes of customers to ensure that the COA contracts are fulfilled basically as scheduled. In market downturn, taking a more market-oriented and flexible pricing mechanism is in the best interests of the Company as a whole. International dry bulk shipment became another major business highlight of the Company in 2014. The Company continued to strengthen development of international dry bulk market and further optimised the structure of offshore cargo supply, achieving significant improvement in offshore operation. The turnover of international dry bulk shipment handled in the year was 167.2 billion tonnes-nautical miles, and the operating revenue was RMB4.155 billion, representing an increase of 23.7% and 33.4% respectively over the same period in 2013; the Company realized gross profit of RMB586 million and gross margin of 14.1%, increased by 4.8 percentage points year-on-year. For very large ore carriers (“VLOC”) fleet operation, the Company relied on long-term COA shipment contracts to finalize source of cargoes in advance, ensuring the smooth operation of all 14 VLOCs. In 2014, importation of 26.17 million tonnes of iron ores was completed with a revenue of RMB2.61 billion, a year-on-year increase of 8.7% and 22.9%, respectively. A gross profit of RMB680 million was realized, representing an increase of RMB280 million and a gross margin of 26.3%, which played an important role in ensuring the Company’s benefits. In terms of small and medium fleet, fully aware of the slowing growth in coastal coal transportation, CS Bulk further strengthened market segment research and judgment, actively adjusted the supply structure, focused on development of food markets, ore markets and steel material markets, increased solicitation for imported coal and fertilizers, and vigorously develop the markets in Pacific, Atlantic, America, West Asia and India. In 2014, total volume of international and domestic non- coal cargo shipment was 46.02 million tonnes, representing 40.5% of the total volume of dry bulk cargo shipment, an increase of 7.2% year-on-year. Furthermore, the Company strengthened the efforts on international chartering of vessels and leased out three Capesize vessels by seizing a high market rate. Through a series of effective measures, the Company’s international dry bulk cargo fleet has achieved significant improvement in operating efficiency, with the daily profit margins of the Capesize and Panamax vessels of the Company much higher than those of international markets in the corresponding periods. In 2014, the Group achieved a shipping volume of approximately 239.58 billion tonne-nautical miles of dry bulk cargo, representing an increase of approximately 18.7% year-on-year; operating revenue derived from dry bulk cargo transportation was approximately RMB6.774 billion, representing an increase of 13.8% year-on-year.

The international economic condition in 2015 is expected to remain complicated and variable, and while the growth of global economy is likely to be rebounded narrowly, it’s difficult to achieve obvious turnaround from the overall weak recovery trend, and it is anticipated that low growth rate may become a normal trend in the next few years. Global trading growth will likely be restrained by the fragile economy growth rate. Against the backdrop of global economy entering into the new normal and insufficient market demand of transportation, the over-capacity issue is unlikely to achieve substantial improvement in the short term, it is expected that the overall international shipping market will remain at a low level. Nonetheless, it is expected that the international oil prices closely-related to operation of shipping enterprises will also remain at a low level in 2015 due to oversupply, thus likely relieving the cost pressure of shipping enterprises.

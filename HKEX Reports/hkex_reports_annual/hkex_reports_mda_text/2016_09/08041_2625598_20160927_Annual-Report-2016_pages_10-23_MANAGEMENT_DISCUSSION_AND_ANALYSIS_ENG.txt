For the year ended 30 June 2016 (the “Year”), loss attributable to owners of the Company (including continuing and discontinued operations) was approximately HK$47,251,000. Comparing to loss attributable to owners of the Company (including continuing and discontinued operations) for year ended 30 June 2015 of approximately HK$245,444,000, the decrease in loss attributable to the owners of the Company was mainly attributable to (i) approximately HK$37,900,000 of allowance for impairment of goodwill made for swimwear cash-generating unit (2015: HK$276,054,000); (ii) no allowance for impairment of goodwill made for provision of on-line shopping, advertising and media related services cash-generating unit (2015: HK$6,250,000); (iii) no loss shared by the Group from an associate (2015: HK$8,070,000); (iv) decrease in administrative expenses to approximately HK$26,564,000 (2015: HK$37,824,000); (v) no loss incurred from discontinued operation during the Year (2015: HK$9,255,000); (vi) decrease in finance cost to approximately HK$525,000 (2015: HK$4,296,000) as the promissory notes had been settled in October 2014, and partially set off by (vii) no gain on deemed disposal of an associate during the Year (2015: HK$61,628,000) and (viii) decrease in gross profit to approximately HK$5,848,000 (2015: HK$22,328,000). For the Year, the Group’s total revenue (including continuing and discontinued operations) and gross profit (including continuing and discontinued operations) were approximately HK$139,981,000 and HK$5,848,000 respectively, as comparing to approximately HK$157,654,000 and HK$47,344,000 respectively for the year ended 30 June 2015. Details of the decrease in total revenue are discussed below: Manufacturing and trading of high-end swimwear and garment products (“Swimwear and garment segment”) The revenue generated from Swimwear and garment segment for the Year was approximately HK$136,981,000 (2015: HK$118,137,000). Gross profit for the Year was approximately HK$3,147,000 (2015: HK$20,970,000). Gross profit ratio for the Year was 2.30% (2015: 17.75%). Increase in revenue was mainly due to the contribution from Ricotex on sales of garment and related products and it was partially offset by the decrease in orders for high-end swimwear from several customers which were affected by the economic downturn of European market and the effect of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union during the Year. Decrease in gross profit for the current year was mainly due to (i) the decrease of selling price resulted from the economic downturn of European markets; and (ii) the increase of portion on sales of garment products with lower gross profit margin, which were manufactured by the factories of Ricotex in the Kingdom of Cambodia (“Cambodia”) that still expanding in order to enjoy the benefit from economies in scale. (i) Provision of on-line shopping, advertising and media related services (“On-line shopping and advertising segment”) The revenue generated from On-line shopping and advertising segment for the Year was approximately HK$3,000,000 (2015: HK$3,114,000). Gross profit for the Year was approximately HK$2,701,000 (2015: HK$1,358,000). Gross profit ratio for the Year was 90.03% (2015: 43.61%). The increase in gross profit for the year was mainly due to revenue for this segment was mainly generated from information technology services provided. Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, this segment became inactive. Trading and retail of apparel and related accessories (“Apparel and related accessories segment”) (discontinued operation) The revenue generated from Apparel and related accessories segment for the year ended 30 June 2015 was approximately HK$36,403,000. Gross profit for the year ended 30 June 2015 was approximately HK$25,016,000. Gross profit ratio for the year ended 30 June 2015 was 68.72%. No consolidation was required for this segment upon disposal of this segment since October 2014. For the Year, the Group’s total impairment of goodwill was approximately HK$37,900,000, comparing to approximately HK$282,304,000 for the year ended 30 June 2015. (i) The impairment of goodwill relates to the swimwear cash-generating unit (“Swimwear CGU”) An impairment of goodwill relates to Swimwear CGU was approximately HK$37,900,000 for the Year (2015: HK$276,054,000). The recoverable amount of the Swimwear CGU is determined from value in use calculation (2015: value in use calculation). The key assumptions are those regarding the discount rate, growth rate and budgeted gross margin and turnover during the period. The Group estimates discount rate using pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. The growth rate is based on long-term average economic growth rate of the geographical area in which the business of the CGU operates. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Directors for the next five years with residual period using the growth rate of 3.99% (2015: 3.99%). This rate does not exceed the average long- term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the Group’s activities of manufacturing and trading of high-end swimwear and related garment products is 14.57% (2015: 14.96%). Based on the past performance and expecting of economic downturn of European market and increase in production costs in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) in the coming years, the Group has revised its cash flow forecasts for the Swimwear CGU. The goodwill has therefore been reduced to its recoverable amount through recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill of approximately HK$37,900,000 for the Year (2015: HK$276,054,000). (ii) The impairment of goodwill relates to provision of on- line shopping advertising and media related services (“On-line shopping and advertising segment”) The recoverable amount of the provision of on-line shopping, advertising and media related services CGU was determined from value in use calculation. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding the discount rate, growth rate and budgeted gross margin and revenue during the period. The Group estimates discount rate using pre- tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. The growth rate is based on long-term average economic growth rate of the geographical area in which the business of the CGU operates. Budgeted gross margin and revenue are based on past practices and expectations on market development. During the six months ended 31 December 2014, the Group prepared cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the directors for the next five years with residual period using the growth rate of 5%. This rate did not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the provision of on-line shopping, advertising and media related services CGU was 13.22%. Based on the past performance, the Group had revised its cash flow forecasts and the recoverable amount for this CGU was negligible. The goodwill allocated to this CGU was thus considered as non- recoverable. The goodwill has therefore been fully impaired through recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill of approximately HK$6,250,000 during the six months ended 31 December 2014 and year ended 30 June 2015. The investment in Charmston (Holdings) Limited is accounted for as available-for-sale financial assets. The fair value of the available- for-sale financial assets is determined by the market comparable approach calculated based on the average price-to-book ratio and average price-to-sales ratio of several companies listed on the Stock Exchange (the “Comparables”). At 30 June 2016, after a 24.90% (2015: 29.75%) discount on lack of marketability (determined by the density function for the maximum of a Brownian motion process by adopting average annualised volatility of the Comparables and assuming marketing period is approximately 6 months (2015: 6 months), the fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is approximately HK$2,998,000 (2015: HK$2,998,000). Key unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. During the Year, the Group maintained an effective cost measures in controlling the cost structure of its operations. Besides, the Group will be extremely prudent in the expansion of its operations in an organic manner. We also believe that it is of the Group’s best interest to explore different sources of income while still maintains an effective and efficient overhead structure for our supporting departments in each of the business segments under operation. As at 30 June 2016, the Group had total assets of approximately HK$220,495,000 (2015: HK$248,457,000). As at 30 June 2016, the Group had short term borrowings (including continuing and discontinued operations) of approximately HK$19,500,000 (2015: HK$10,000,000). The increase of total borrowings was mainly due to the further contribution funding from a non- controlling shareholder of Ricotex during the Year. As at 30 June 2016, the Group had bank and cash balances of approximately HK$48,556,000 (2015: HK$71,773,000). The Group has a current ratio of approximately 1.32 comparing to that of 2.05 as at 30 June 2015. As at 30 June 2016, the Group’s gearing ratio of 11% (2015: –14%) was calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities (including current and non-current liabilities as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total equity represents the equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. Our Group’s financial condition, results of operations and business prospects may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties directly or indirectly pertaining to our Group’s businesses. The followings are the key risks and uncertainties identified by our Group. There may be other risks and uncertainties in addition to those shown below which are not known to our Group or which may not be material now but could be material in the future: The Group’s five largest suppliers, which accounted for 68% (2015: 55%) of the Group’s total purchase, are mainly related to the purchase of fabric. Except for purchase of fabric from Dakota Industrial Company Limited (“Dakota”), of which a supply agreement has entered into, there is no assurance that other major suppliers shall continue to provide the fabric to us at price acceptable to our Group. In the event that our Group were unable to retain these suppliers, or procure replacement suppliers, our business, results of operations, profitability and liquidity might be adversely affected. However, the Group has established strong business relationship with these major suppliers. The Group’s five largest customers, which accounted for 70% (2015: 64%) of the Group’s total turnover. Except for sale to Dakota, of which a sales agreement has entered into, there is no assurance that other major customers will continue to conduct business with us. In the event that other major customers materially reduce their purchase orders with the Group or cease to conduct business with the Group and the Group fails to obtain a comparable level of purchase orders from new customers, the Group’s business, result of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Customer satisfaction with our products has a profound effects on our profitability. To provide good quality services to our customers, our Group is in constant communication with our customers and potential customers to uncover and create customer needs and help customers make informed decision. The Group’s total sales to the customers in the European countries, which accounted for 49% (2015: 64%)of the Group’s total revenue for the Year. The Group derives a majority of its sales from the exports to the European countries, including but not limited to France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. Any unexpected economic, political and social events in the European countries may have significant impact on retail consumptions which could, in turn, affect the financial performance of the Group. For instance, the economies and financial system of the European countries were adversely hit by the global financial crisis recently. The Group cannot assure whether these European countries will continue to deteriorate or when the European market will cover. Should these European countries’ markets continue to deteriorate and the Group is unable to compensate such deterioration of these European countries economy with other strategic moves, the Group’s business operations and financial positions will be adversely jeopardised. Therefore, the Group has diversified its market from European countries and expand to other countries and from swimwear business and expand to garment products by set up Ricotex in 2014, of which is engaged in trading and manufacturing of garment products and related accessories and other related business, to minimise our risk on too reliance on European countries as majority of Ricotex’s customers for its garment products are come from Hong Kong. The Group business transactions, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi and United States dollars, of which the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is considered limited. During the Year, the Group did not carry out any hedging activity against foreign currency risk. Any substantial exchange rate fluctuation of foreign currencies against Renminbi may have a financial impact on the Group. The Group will continue to monitor its foreign exchange position and, if necessary, utilise hedging tools, if available, to manage its foreign currency exposure. Investment risk can be defined as the likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment. Key concern of investment framework will be balancing risk and return across different investments, and thus risk assessment is a core aspect of the investment decision process. Proper authorisation system has been set up and detailed analysis will be made before approving investments. Regular updates on the progress of the investments of our Group would be submitted to the Board.

As at 30 June 2016, the Group had 2,124 full time employees compared with that of 1,276 in the previous financial year. The staff costs, including directors’ remuneration, were approximately HK$58,672,000 (2015: HK$49,414,000). The Group offers a comprehensive remuneration package and benefits to its full time employees in compliance with the regulations in Hong Kong, the PRC and the Cambodia respectively, including medical scheme, provident fund or retirement fund. In addition, the Group adopts a share option scheme for eligible employees (including Directors) and consultants to provide incentives to participants for their contributions and continuing efforts to promote the interests of the Group. As at 30 June 2016, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities (2015: Nil). The Group has pledged bank deposits of approximately HK$613,000 (2015: HK$641,000) to secure banking facilities granted to the Group. For the Swimwear and garment segment, due to the recent economic downturn of European market and effect of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the orders on hand for high-end swimwear for the factory located in the PRC decreased and is expected to decrease continuously in the coming year as comparing with last year. In order to seek new business opportunities, a non-wholly owned subsidiary, Ricotex, has established and is operating two factories in the Cambodia to manufacture swimwear and garment products. Due to the import tariff tax benefit offer to European customers, the operation in Ricotex can attract more European customers and therefore Ricotex can stimulate and increase revenue for swimwear and garment segment in the future. In order to diversify our products, we are developing new products with our new/existing business partners during the Year, we expect there would be new orders received in coming years. Also, our Group continues to closely monitor and control cost in order to push up the gross profit margin of Swimwear and garment segment. For the On-line shopping and advertising segment, it has been making losses for several years and subsequent to year end date, this segment becomes inactive. Our Group continues to seek and explore other business opportunity for the On-line shopping and advertising segment. The management of the Group continues to formulate its business strategies to optimise the use of its operating and financial resources. It will consider to diversify its operations including but not limited to invest in financial instruments in order to ensure cash availability through managing cash on hand to best meet the Group’s cash and liquidity needs to management risk. It will also consider to reorganise the non-performing business segments including but not limited to the disposal or downsizing of the non- performing business segments.

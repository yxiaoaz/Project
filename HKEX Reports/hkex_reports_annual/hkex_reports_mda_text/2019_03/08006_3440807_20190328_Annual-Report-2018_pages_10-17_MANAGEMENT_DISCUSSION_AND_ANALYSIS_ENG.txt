It is evident that travel and tourism remains strong despite the ever-increasing and unpredictable challenges such as geopolitical instability, health pandemics and natural disasters.

It is followed by Europe and the Middle East which enjoyed 6% growth while Africa and the Americas enjoyed growth at 5% and 3% respectively.

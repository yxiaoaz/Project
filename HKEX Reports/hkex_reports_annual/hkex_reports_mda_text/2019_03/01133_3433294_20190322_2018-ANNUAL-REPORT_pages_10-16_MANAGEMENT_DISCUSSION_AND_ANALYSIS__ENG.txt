Affected by the macroeconomic environment both at home and abroad and the development trend of the industry, the overall sales scale of the Group declined. The hydropower market ushers in the peak of pumped storage development and the proportion of revenue generated from the hydropower main equipment segment has increased. However, as the majority of overseas projects have passed the peak season of execution, the newly entered projects were in the early stage of construction and the proportion of revenue generated from the power station engineering services segment decreased significantly. In 2018, the Group recorded an income of export of RMB7,397.40 million (or 28.58% of the total operating income), decreasing by RMB3,205.75 million over the previous year. The export was dominated by Asia and South America, in which export to Asia amounting to RMB6,841.70 million while export to South America amounting to RMB382.96 million. In 2018, the operating costs of the Group amounted to RMB22,687.53 million, representing a decrease of 16.80% as compared with the corresponding period of last year, mainly due to the decrease in sales scale. In 2018, the Group realized a gross profit from operating business of RMB3,191.93 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of 25.29%, and a gross profit margin was 12.33%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 1.21%. Out of the gross profit, RMB1,670.21 million was attributable to the gross profit from main thermal power equipments, decreasing by RMB630.31 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 14.06%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 2.52%; RMB151.31 million was attributable to the gross profit from main hydropower equipment, decreasing by RMB31.02 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 8.88%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 7.03%; RMB253.43 million was attributable to the gross profit from engineering services for power stations, decreasing by RMB243.90 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 3.42%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 1.23%; RMB90.24 million was attributable to the gross profit from ancillary equipment and supplementary products for power stations, decreasing by RMB104.96 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 10.03%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.55%; RMB746.98 million was attributable to the gross profit from AC/DC motors and other products and services, increasing by RMB169.35 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 28.21%, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.59%; RMB279.76 million was attributable to the gross profit from nuclear products, decreasing by RMB239.60 million over the previous year, while the corresponding gross profit margin was 20.90%, representing a year-on-year decrease of 4.65%. The decrease in our Group’s gross profit margin was firstly due to the volume of products launched in the market decreased year by year as a result of the overcapacity of domestic coal power capacity, and the tender price of products continued to decline; secondly, was due to the commodity price fluctuated, and steel price rose faster in line with the increase in material cost of products. In 2018, the Group’s selling expenses incurred amounted to RMB731.24 million, representing an increase of RMB91.86 million or 14.37% as compared to the corresponding period of last year, primarily due to we stepped up efforts to collect trade receivables during the year, which resulted in a year-on-year increase of defect elimination cost; the administrative expenses incurred amounted to RMB1,465.16 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of RMB229.86 million or 13.56%, which mainly due to a year-on-year decrease in labor costs; the research and development expenses incurred amounted to RMB591.93 million, representing a year-on-year increase of RMB33.25 million or 5.95%; the finance expenses incurred amounted to RMB36.10 million, representing a year-on-year decrease of RMB286.69 million or 88.82%, mainly due to the decrease in interest expense as a result of the reduction of interest-bearing debts, and the increase in net exchange gain resulted from the changes in exchange rate. Annual Report 2018 The Group financed its operation and development with three major funding sources, namely shareholder’s funds, trade receivables from customers and bank borrowings.

As at 31 December 2018, the amount of the Group’s deposits in foreign currencies was equivalent to RMB722.76 million. The export business and businesses settled in foreign currencies expose the Group to exchange risk. The Company has fully utilized its proceeds from issuance of shares and bonds in previous years, and no other fund-raising activities was proceeded in this year. The Board does not propose the payment of a final dividend for 2018. Despite the increasing demand for energy resources in China and worldwide, the business environment of power generation equipment manufacturers is becoming increasingly challenging with the increasing competition in the market and the increasing concern for power generation from clean and renewable generation instead of coal-fired power. In China, the proportion of total new coal-fired power capacity continued to decrease, and thermal power market continued to decline; in the meantime, hydropower generation maintains a moderate growth, while other mainstream renewable energy power generation modes, such as wind power and solar power, are expected to continue to seize the market share; the clean energy market is expected to maintain a rapid development; the international market still has room but competition will become more intensified. In 2019, the Group will focus on its development strategy and promote high-quality development with reform and innovation as driving force. During the year, the Group will endeavor to seize the market share, decrease the “account receivables and inventory”, cut off costs, reduce redundancies and improve quality in order to strengthen the foundation for development; will implement the industrial layout, enhance technological innovation, enlarge power station service industry, develop new industries and solve the key development; will promote the reform of allocation, optimize the assessment system, improve the management and control models and strengthen the development impetuses; will strive to build itself into a world-class equipment manufacturing enterprise with global competitiveness. 7 March 2019

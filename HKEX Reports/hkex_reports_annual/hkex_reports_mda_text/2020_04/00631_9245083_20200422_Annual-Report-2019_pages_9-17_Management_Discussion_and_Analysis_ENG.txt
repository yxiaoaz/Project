equipment in Southeast Asia, Pan-Russia, Africa, etc., establishment of self-operated channels for logistics equipment in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, UEA, etc., and strategic cooperation with major customers such as MARITIME of UK and Maersk. The coverage of the Group’s overseas marketing channels has primarily reached a substantial scale. During 2019, the sales revenues of the Group’s various products maintained steady growth, and in particular, the growth for mining transport equipment is over 300% as compared to last year. Through digital transformation and strengthening of internal management, the percentage of management expenses (excluding R&D expenses) against revenue continued to decrease and consolidated gross margin increased. The high gross margins of two core products namely roadheader and front loader were maintained, and the gross margin of integrated coal mining product increased significantly as compared to last year. The Group divides its products into two categories, namely (1) the mining equipment business sector (previously known as energy equipment business sector), which includes coal mining machinery products, such as roadheaders (all types of soft rock, hard rock roadheader and integrated excavation, bolting and self-protection machine) and mining equipment (coal mining machines (shearer), hydraulic support system, scraper conveyor (Armored-Face Conveyer), etc.); non-coal mining machinery products, such as tunnel roadheader and mining machine; the mining transport equipment (mechanical drive off-highway dump truck and electric drive off-highway dump truck) and widebody vehicle and other relevant products; and (2) the logistics equipment business sector (previously known as port machinery business sector), which includes container equipment* (front loader, stacking machine and quayside gantry crane, etc.), bulk material equipment (gripper, elevated hoisting arm, etc.) and general equipment (heavy-duty forklift truck, telehandler, etc.). * Note: Container equipment include large-scale port machinery products (such as quayside gantry crane) and small-scale port machinery products (such as front loader and stacking machine). The Group insists on developing R&D innovation-driven strategy to transform and upgrade products through intelligent, electrification and unmanned related R&D in line with new demands of industrial development. During 2019, the Group made notable achievement in innovation with new automated and electric products launched which include new energy-saving green products such as intelligent coal mining machine, electric widebody vehicle, electric stacking machine, electric steel and material grippers, second generation electric truck and unmanned electric truck. For mining equipment, breakthroughs have been achieved in the transparent work face of integrated coal mining such as advanced detection and coal rock intelligent identification, and the automated work face of thin-seam coal achieved phased verification, laying the foundation for commercialisation. The remote intelligent control technology of roadheaders successfully realised cutting operation beyond visual distance and minor errors in the shape and posture of tunnels which will lead industrial development. MG730i intelligent coal mining machine effectively solved challenges faced by the industry in relation to the large undulation, frequent faults, limited space and inefficient coal loading for thin-seam coal. As compared to fuel vehicles, the new generation SKT90E electric widebody vehicle consumes less energy, operates with an environmentally effective way and has lower failure rate, and attracts wide attention of customers upon launching. For logistics equipment, the 10K and 12K telehandlers were launched to the market. An array of grippers including 50T Electric, 40T Tyred Electric, 50T Track and 35T, and large port machinery such as large front-stretching distance 4547 quayside container crane, river port 3538 quayside crane and 8070 double-lift quayside crane were developed, which further completed the product spectrum. The Group’s first fully electric container stacker accelerates the green transformation and upgrade of ports with its environmental friendliness, easy maintenance and quiet operation. The unmanned electric truck enables automated connection between quayside cranes and transtainers, and provides higher precision and faster loading and unloading while reducing the need of human intervention significantly. The automated transtainers have applied multiple key automation technologies and realised remote control, intelligent identification, precise alignment, automated loading and unloading, which notably enhances the efficiency of port operations. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group obtained 18 invention patents, 21 utility model patents, 2 design patents, and 9 copyrights. The Group has production and manufacturing bases in Shenyang, Zhuhai and Changsha, respectively. There are 8 plants in the mining equipment industrial park located in the Economic and Technological Development Zone of Shenyang with a total area of approximately 629,000 sq.m. The industrial park for large port machinery is located in Gaolan Port Economic Area of Zhuhai and commenced operation on 6 May 2015. Phase 1 of the project occupies an area of 800 mu, equipped with a deep-water dock with a coastline of 3.5 km which has currently reached the production capability of full range large-scale port machinery. The industrial park for small port equipment is located in the Changsha Industrial Zone with an area of approximately 100,000 sq.m., with several plants and commissioning fields. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group continued to pursue digitalisation. With the networking of production equipment and intelligent monitoring system, real-time and on-site remote monitoring of physical objects was realized, which enables online accessibility to the data related to the energy consumption and operation condition of production facilities. The Group also installed visual equipment at the production workshop to facilitate remote monitoring of production and achieve efficient visual management, with a view to enhancing site production management, standardising operation and improving efficiency of production personnel. In addition, the Group rationally arranges production working hours and allocates resources through intelligent dispatching platform based on order arrangement. Currently, great progress and enhancement are realised in production capability through digitalisation, and basic data for production management and energy management is now available through the production equipment energy management platform. Furthermore, the in-depth analysis of basic data such as electric current and energy would optimize production process in terms of minimising energy consumption and lowering production costs. The Group implements a targeted marketing policy tailored to each major customer with support from our “power trio” team to achieve crucial breakthroughs. The Group has been accelerating its internationalization progress and enhancing its competitiveness in overseas markets.

The Group adheres to its service philosophy of “All For Customers, All From Innovations”, by providing first-class service and highly efficient response to meet customers’ needs and addressing any concerns of our customers. The Group’s superior product quality, attentive after-sales service and efficient response have gained high recognition from our customers. For the year end 31 December 2019, the Group recorded revenue of approximately RMB5,656.1 million, representing an increase of approximately 28.1% as compared with approximately RMB4,416.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. The increase was mainly due to that (1) the mining equipment of the Group are transforming towards intelligent, unmanned and large-scale products, which significantly increased the sales of products in both domestic and international markets; (2) the newly launched widebody vehicles of the Group gained market shares in the domestic and international markets with their excellent performance, continuously driving the revenue of the Group’s mining vehicles to increase significantly on a year-on-year basis; and (3) multiple products of the Group’s logistics equipment sector were highly recognized by the market and recorded substantial growth in sales revenue, among which large scale port equipment such as quayside container crane and transtainer recorded a significant increase in domestic sales, while the accumulated sales revenue of new products such as heavy-duty forklift truck, gripper and electric truck also increased significantly. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group’s other income and gains was approximately RMB488.8 million, representing an increase of approximately 62.3% as compared with approximately RMB301.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018.

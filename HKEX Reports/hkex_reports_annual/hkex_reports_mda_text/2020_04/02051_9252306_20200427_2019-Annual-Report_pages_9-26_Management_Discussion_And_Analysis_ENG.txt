The Company together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group” or “we”) have created a comprehensive ecosystem built upon a widely-used credit card management platform, 51 Credit Card Manager App. In 2019, we continued to maintain steady growth in user base. The number of registered users of 51 Credit Card Manager App grew 12.8% to approximately 85.6 million as of 31 December 2019 from approximately 75.9 million as of 31 December 2018, and the number of credit cards we had managed cumulatively also grew 16.8% to approximately 143.7 million as of 31 December 2019 from approximately 123.0 million as of 31 December 2018. As of 31 December As of 31 December (million) (million) Number of registered users of Number of credit cards We have also been enriching our ecosystem to provide the users with better product experience. We have established cooperation with six banks since the trial operation of the bank wealth management product referral business at the end of 2018. Our users can purchase the wealth management products issued by cooperating banks through the entrance on 51 Credit Card Manager App conveniently. As of 31 December 2019, the accumulated transaction amount of the bank wealth management product referral business had reached approximately RMB27.79 billion. 2019 was a challenging year for the fintech industry. Regulatory authorities of the PRC have issued a series of documents and guidances, specifying that healthy exiting and transformational development would be the general principle for the P2P industry. More efforts were put on P2P transformation and exiting by regulatory authorities across the PRC, and especially after October 2019, a number of provinces announced to start ceasing all P2P platforms in areas under their administration. Meanwhile, the further development of the special crackdown against organized crimes had an extensive effect on the post-loan debt collection industry. Risks in the personal consumption credit market have risen in a short time as a result of many of the above factors. To ensure the risks relating to the debt collection business is controllable, we have stopped engaging independent third parties to collect loans which are overdue by thirty days or more since July 2019, and all relevant collection is managed by our professional debt collection teams directly instead. However, on 21 October 2019, our office located in Hangzhou was under the on-site investigation carried out by the relevant PRC government authorities due to the suspected violation of laws and regulations by a debt collection agency we once cooperated with (the “1021 Event”, please refer to the announcements of the Company dated 21 and 22 October 2019 respectively, for details). After the occurrence of the 1021 Event, we fully cooperated with the investigation and supervision of the relevant authorities and further improved our compliance awareness. Meanwhile, we made efforts to maintain positive communication and cooperation with our business partners and resumed our daily operations soon thereafter. The factors above have exposed our business to relatively significant short-term risks. In particular, the default risk of the outstanding loans facilitated by us rose significantly in the fourth quarter of 2019. To cope with these risks, we have proactively adopted more prudent strategies as compared to 2018, including implementing stricter and more cautious risk control, reducing the scale of the credit facilitation business proactively and stopping new facilitations of P2P funds. The balance of our P2P online lending business decreased from approximately RMB13.24 billion as of 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB5.63 billion as of 31 December 2019 and further decreased to approximately RMB3.5 billion as of 29 February 2020. Year-on- Affected by the risks and strategies above, our total revenue in 2019 decreased from approximately RMB2,812.0 million in 2018 to approximately RMB2,045.4 million, and an adjusted net loss for the year of RMB847.1 million was recorded, mainly due to the decrease in credit facilitation volumes and the increase in expected credit loss (“ECL”) under International Financial Report Standard 9 (“IFRS 9”) as a result of the rising default risk of outstanding loans facilitated by us. In terms of credit facilitation business, affected by the abovementioned regulatory documents, the 1021 Event and other factors, we have adopted a series of measures in 2019, such as reducing business scale, focusing the business on credit card holders with low risks and stopping new facilitations of P2P funds, so as to cope with rising risks relating to personal credit business. In 2019, the overall credit facilitation business scale amounted to approximately RMB23.22 billion, representing a decline compared to 2018. Particularly, the credit facilitation scale attributable to credit card holders amounted to approximately RMB20.09 billion, reaching 86.5% of the overall credit facilitation business scale, and representing an increase as compared to 81.8% in 2018. (i) Meanwhile, facing increasing risks during the transformation period of the P2P industry, we have also reduced the average loan size and average loan term of our main credit products. These two indicators of the loan products targeting credit card holders have decreased from approximately RMB14,900 and approximately 13.6 months in 2018 to approximately RMB10,600 and approximately 10.5 months in 2019, respectively. Such strategy may reduce our revenue from each loan we facilitated in the short term, but we believe that it can diversify the potential risks more effectively and help us to better achieve sustainable development in the long run. To adapt to the tightening regulations in the industry and achieve our strategic goal of long-term sustainable development, we have continued to strengthen our cooperation with various financial institutions since 2019. After the 1021 Event and starting from November 2019, all of the new credit facilitation business was funded by financial institutions. Currently, the credit line of the credit facilitation business we secured from financial institution partners is sufficient to support the long-term and healthy development. (i) The following table shows the volume, number, average amount and average tenure of loans facilitated targeting credit card holders and non-credit card holders, respectively: Loan products targeting Loan products targeting (approximate) (approximate) (approximate) (approximate) RMB20,090.7 RMB20,457.4 RMB3,126.7 RMB4,556.7 (ii) (iii) (ii) The following table shows the proportion of funding sources of the credit facilitation business: Individual investors from 51 Renpin(1) Institutions(2) Notes: 51 Renpin refers to our online investment products. Institutions include a wholly owned micro loan subsidiary of the Company. (iii) The following chart shows the historical cumulative 90-day plus past due delinquency rates by vintage for loan products targeting credit card holders up to 31 December 2019: The following chart shows the historical cumulative 90-day plus past due delinquency rates by vintage for loan products targeting non-credit card holders up to 31 December 2019: Benefiting from the continuous user growth, the improvement in efficiency enabled by the application of technology and the cross-selling opportunities brought by our ecosystem, the referral service fee increased by 42.3% from approximately RMB203.1 million in 2018 to approximately RMB289.1 million in 2019. Affected by the macro environment in 2019, our partner banks tightened their risk strategies for the credit card market. Although we have introduced a number of new partner banks, our revenue from credit card technology service decreased from approximately RMB255.7 million in 2018 to approximately RMB152.3 million in 2019. Our total revenue decreased by 27.3% from approximately RMB2,812.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB2,045.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Credit facilitation and service fee decreased by 42.9% from approximately RMB2,055.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB1,173.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. We generally collect credit facilitation and service fee from borrowers according to the pre- confirmed fee schedules, recognize in our consolidated financial statements the upfront credit facilitation service fee at the inception of the loan and the post credit facilitation service fee over the loan during the year. Compared with 2018, regulatory authorities applied more stringent management on P2P and debt-collection industries in 2019. Personal consumption credit market had experienced substantial fluctuations. Particularly, the default risk of the outstanding loans facilitated by us increased in the fourth quarter of 2019. To cope with the fluctuations, we proactively reduced the scale of credit facilitation business and shortened the average loan term of major credit products, leading to a decrease in credit facilitation and service fee. Our referral service fee increased by 42.3% from approximately RMB203.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB289.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily driven by the increase in business volume as a result of enhanced efficiency and increased users’ demand. Credit card technology service fee decreased by 40.4% from approximately RMB255.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB152.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly because the partner banks in general had adopted rigorous measures with credit card issuance in 2019 as affected by the fluctuations in macro economy, which resulted in a decrease in both the number of credit cards issued to our users through us and the business volume of technology services rendered through our co-branding credit cards as compared to that in the corresponding period in Other revenue increased by 44.7% from approximately RMB297.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB430.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, among which (i) the payment service fee increased by 254.5% from approximately RMB75.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB267.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, due to the increase in business volume of payment channel service; (ii) the interest income of loans to customers decreased by 69.8% from approximately RMB91.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB27.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 primarily due to the lower balance of loans funded by trusts; and (iii) the overdue charges decreased by 65.6% from approximately RMB45.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB15.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 primarily due to a decline in the credit facilitation scale in 2019, and the reduction in the percentage of overdue charges for certain products to increase the repayment willingness of the defaulting users. Our operating expenses increased by 22.7% from approximately RMB2,746.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB3,370.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. Origination and servicing expenses increased by 14.8% from approximately RMB758.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB870.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, including (i) an increase by 68.7% to approximately RMB327.2 million in fund transfer charges for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB194.0 million for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the increased payment service business volume; (ii) an increase by 5.4% to approximately RMB235.4 million in external technical service fee for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB223.3 million for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the increased demand for third-party technical services such as loan collection services and credit assessment data usage; (iii) a decrease by 16.3% to approximately RMB153.9 million in employee benefit expenses for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB183.8 million for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the decrease in headcount as a result of downsizing of the business, despite an increase of approximately RMB0.2 million of share-based compensation expenses; and (iv) an increase by 71.2% to approximately RMB45.7 million in depreciation and amortization for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB26.7 million for the corresponding period in 2018, mainly due to the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases during the year. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 26.5% from approximately RMB618.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB454.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, as we reduced sales and marketing spending in 2019 along with the enhanced operating efficiency and the downsizing of the business. General and administrative expenses decreased by 29.1% from approximately RMB411.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB291.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, which mainly represents (i) the decrease of listing expenses from approximately RMB37.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to nil for the year ended 31 December 2019, as the initial listing of the shares of the (the “Shares”) Company on the Stock Exchange was completed in 2018; and (ii) a decrease by 33.3% to approximately RMB189.4 million in employee benefit expenses for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB284.0 million for the corresponding period in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in headcount of administrative staff as a result of the downsizing of the business, including a decrease of approximately RMB77.6 million of share-based compensation expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by 40.7% from approximately RMB328.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB194.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The demand in research and development personnel decreased in 2019 because of the downsizing of the business and the enhanced efficiency brought by technology application, which caused a decrease of 43.7% in research and development employee benefit expenses to approximately RMB156.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB277.2 million for the corresponding period in 2018, despite an increase in share-based compensation expenses of approximately RMB3.1 million. Other losses, net increased by 147.6% from approximately RMB629.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB1,559.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, which mainly represents (i) the fair value loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”) amounted to approximately RMB137.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly as we disposed of a number of financial assets at FVPL in 2019. Affected by macroeconomic environment, the disposal prices (being the fair values upon the disposals) of certain financial assets at FVPL were higher than their investment cost but lower than their fair value assessed at the end of 2018, leading to the recognition of the fair value loss on financial assets at FVPL in 2019. No financial assets at FVPL was disposed of in the corresponding period in 2018, therefore no loss on the disposal of financial assets at FVPL was recorded; (ii) the quality assurance fund loss increased by 148.2% to a loss of approximately RMB858.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from a loss of approximately RMB345.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, as a result of the fluctuating personal credit market in 2019. The delinquency performance of the credit business in 2019 was worse than the corresponding period in 2018. Meanwhile, the downsizing of the new credit facilitation business scale in 2019 also resulted in higher proportion of the defaulting users in the balance of the loan products than the corresponding period in 2018; (iii) the ECL for financial assets other than quality assurance fund receivable/payable increased by 57.5% to approximately RMB407.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB258.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, mainly due to increasing difficulties in the collection of contract assets as a result of the fluctuations in the industry; (iv) the impairment loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 amounted to approximately RMB184.7 million, mainly consisting of approximately RMB145.8 million of impairment loss of goodwill. We will adopt a more conservative strategy for our business in response to increasing risks of the personal credit market. For instance, we will have the scale of credit facilitation maintained at a relatively low level over a period of time, and such strategy is expected to contribute to less future cash inflow of the Group, which would result in impairment of goodwill. There is no impairment of goodwill in the corresponding period in 2018 as the implemented strategy was less conservative than that of 2019; and (v) the interest expenses to trust senior tranche holders decreased by 80.0% to approximately RMB8.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB44.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, as a result of a lower balance of loans funded by trusts. Share of net loss of associates accounted for using equity method increased by 153.8% from a loss of approximately RMB1.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to a loss of approximately RMB3.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly because of a greater amount of loss of several associates in 2019 than that in the corresponding period in 2018. The fair value gain of preferred shares was nil for the year ended 31 December 2019, while the fair value gain of preferred shares amounted to approximately RMB1,942.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, as all preferred shares had been converted to ordinary shares in 2018 with the initial listing of the Shares on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange. Fair value gain of financial liability at FVPL decreased by 53.0% from approximately RMB98.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB46.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly because the decrease in the amount in the market value of the financial liability in 2019 was less than that in the corresponding period in 2018. Finance expenses, net decreased by 79.5% from approximately RMB24.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB5.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in interest expenses due to the reduction in amount of indebtedness. Income tax credit increased by 100.2% from an income tax credit of approximately RMB88.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to an income tax credit of approximately RMB176.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly because the quality assurance fund loss, the ECL for financial assets other than quality assurance fund receivable/payable and impairment loss that had been provided but not yet incurred as at 31 December 2019 were higher than that in the corresponding period in 2018, and such items were deductible when incurred, which resulted in higher corresponding income tax credit. Our (loss)/profit for the year decreased from a net profit of approximately RMB2,168.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to a net loss of approximately RMB1,111.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily because (i) all preferred shares had been converted to ordinary shares in 2018 with the initial listing of the Shares on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange and the fair value gain of preferred shares decreased to nil for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB1,942.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018; (ii) credit facilitation and service fee decreased from approximately RMB2,055.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB1,173.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 due to the smaller scale of credit product facilitation and shorter average tenure in 2019 than that in the corresponding period in 2018; and (iii) the quality assurance fund loss increased to a loss of approximately RMB858.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from a loss of approximately RMB345.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, as a result of the fluctuations in the industry in 2019. We compensate for the limitations of the non-IFRS measures by reconciling the non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest IFRS performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. The adjusted net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 was approximately RMB847.1 million, compared with the adjusted net profit of approximately RMB374.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. The following table reconciles our adjusted net (loss)/profit in the years presented to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, which is (loss)/profit for the year: Adjusted for: The Group maintained a net cash position throughout the year under review. Our net cash positions as at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 are as follows: As at 31 December As at 31 December Cash and cash equivalents include cash at banks and other short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Liquid investments are primarily wealth management products issued by banks and held with the primary objective of generating income at a yield higher than current deposit bank interest rates. All liquid investments were expired in 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are denominated in the United States dollars (the “US dollars”), Renminbi (“RMB”) and Hong Kong dollars. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group recorded net cash inflow of approximately RMB77.0 million, primarily as a result of net cash flow generated from operating activities of approximately RMB200.5 million and net cash flow generated from investing activities of approximately RMB577.9 million, offset by net cash used in financing activities of approximately RMB705.4 million. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The gearing ratio, calculated as total borrowings divided by total assets, was 2.9% as at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: 8.0%). The following table sets forth the maturity profile of our borrowings within the years indicated: As at 31 December As at 31 December The bank and other borrowings as at 31 December 2019 were denominated in RMB (31 December 2018: RMB). The Group’s subsidiaries primarily operate in the PRC and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. For the Group’s PRC subsidiaries whose functional currency is RMB, if US dollars had strengthened/weakened by 5% against RMB with all other variables held constant, the loss before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2019 would have been approximately RMB2,068,000 higher/lower as a result of net foreign exchange gains/(losses) on translation of net monetary liabilities denominated in US dollars, and the profit before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would have been approximately RMB584,000 higher/lower as a result of net foreign exchange gains/(losses) on translation of net monetary assets denominated in US dollars. For the Group’s PRC subsidiaries whose functional currency is RMB, if Hong Kong dollars had strengthened/weakened by 5% against RMB with all other variables held constant, the loss before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2019 would have been approximately RMB17,000 lower/higher, and the profit before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would have been approximately RMB5,708,000 higher/lower, as a result of net foreign exchange gains/(losses) on translation of net monetary assets denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The Group would enter into foreign exchange forward contracts depending on specific circumstance to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts within the exposure generated from time to time. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group had charged its properties located in Building B3, Wenyi West Road, No. 588 Hangzhou, PRC in favour of Wenchuang Branch of Hangzhou Bank for obtaining a mortgage loan of a total sum of RMB53 million. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group did not have any significant investments. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group did not have any material acquisition or disposal. Save as disclosed in Note 39 to the consolidated financial information as set out in this report, the Group did not have any other material contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: Nil). The pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus was firstly discovered in Hubei Province and then spread throughout the PRC rapidly since January 2020. To prevent further spread of the disease, all local governments in the PRC have put in place rigorous prevention measures, including extension of the Chinese New Year holiday, restriction on public transport, requesting enterprises to delay the resumption of work, etc. The abovementioned measures will have adverse effect on personal consumption financial market in the short term. However, we expect that the demand of personal consumption will rebound after the end of epidemic, leading to further growth in the consumption financial market. We also expect that the PRC government will implement looser monetary policies with the aim to stimulate the economic growth, including increasing the investment in personal consumption lending, reducing the funding cost, etc. Therefore, we foresee that our credit facilitation business and credit card technology service business will make improvements as directly benefiting from the gradual recovery of the personal consumption financial market after the end of epidemic. Meanwhile, we will keep paying attention to the trend of risk changes in the personal consumption financial market and adjust our business strategy in a timely manner to seize the favorable opportunity of development arising from the recovering financial market. In 2020, we will also prepare for the overall exiting and transforming of the P2P business. Benefiting from our quality customer base of credit card business that we have accumulated over the years, together with our comprehensive ecological service system built on the credit card management tools, which consist of management and repayment of credit cards, personal wealth management, consumer credit and other services, we have established solid cooperation with various financial institutions. Our rich experiences in working with various financial institutions will provide our business with sufficient support for the long-term and sustainable development. We will continuously strengthen the cooperation with financial institutions and enhance the output of our technological capability. In addition, we are now proactively seeking measures to apply for the license for the Internet micro credit business mentioned in the Guidance on the Transformation of Online Lending Information Intermediary Institutions into Pilot Micro Credit Companies in order to fully transform and exit the P2P business. We expect that by seizing the new opportunities arising after the transformation from the license for the Internet micro credit business and based on the cooperation with other financial institutions, our long-term and sustainable development of the credit facilitation business will be supported. Since the fourth quarter of 2019, pursuant to the promotion made by regulatory authorities of the PRC, P2P operators have begun to connect to the Credit Reference Center of the People’s Bank of China (the “Reference Center”) successively. Currently, we are in progress of connecting to the Reference Center. With the gradual optimization of the individual credit reference system in the PRC, we believe that the risk performance of individual consumption credit aspect is becoming more stable. We expect to see a favorable movement in the collection of the bad debts arising from previous credit facilitation business. In conclusion, in the promising and challenging year of 2020, we, by leveraging on our highly compliant business philosophy, unique business model, advanced technology and large user base, with strategic objective of long-term and sustainable development, will continue to maintain our competitive advantages in the financial technology market in the PRC.

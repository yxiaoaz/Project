The principal activity of the Company is investment holding. Its subsidiaries are principally engaged in gold exploration, mining and mineral processing with gold concentrate as its product. In 2008, when the Company acquired the indirect equity interest in Tongguan Taizhou Mining Company Limited* (“Taizhou Mining”), the Company agreed to provide financial support to Taizhou Mining for Taizhou Mining’s development. After two years of development and since 2010, the Company began to fall short of the originally agreed financial support to Taizhou Mining. In view of the discontinuation of the agreed financial support from the Company to Taizhou Mining and in order not to hinder the development of Taizhou Mining, Taizhou Mining sourced and successfully obtained financial support from financier(s) since According to the arrangement as agreed between Taizhou Mining and one of its financiers, Taizhou Mining adopted a new operating model of obtaining loans from financier and having its inventories pledged as collateral (the “Operating Model”). Notwithstanding the pledge of inventories as collateral, legal title and risk of inventories remain with Taizhou Mining. The financier is chargor of inventories only and has the right to monitor the financial function of Taizhou Mining for the purposes of securing its loans to Taizhou Mining. The financier has agreed with Taizhou Mining not to demand repayment of loans until Taizhou Mining has the financial capability to do so. The financier has further agreed that in the event that Taizhou Mining is unable to repay the indebtedness as they fall due, the financier would be able to realise the collateral on behalf of Taizhou Mining, and apply the amount as agreed between Taizhou Mining and the financier(s) at the time when the collateral is pledged to the financier, to set off against any outstanding loan and interest as they fall due at the agreed value. As a result of the Operating Model, the property (mostly exploration and mining tunnels and inclined mining shafts), plant and equipment of the Group had substantially increased from approximately HK$4.1 million as at 31 March 2010 to approximately HK$320.6 million as at 31 March 2011 notwithstanding the Group recorded no revenue for the year ended 31 March 2011 (2010: HK$100.2 million) as its inventories were pledged to its financier. Respective state of affairs of the Group is set out in the consolidated financial statements on pages 42 to 143 of this report. In the year ended 31 March 2011, the Company recorded consolidated loss of approximately HK$1,467.9 million compared with a loss of approximately HK$23.2 million in previous year. Such a change was mainly attributable to an impairment loss of goodwill of approximately HK$1,408.1 million and other losses of approximately HK$26.5 million incurred by the Group during the year under review. The aforesaid impairment loss of approximately HK$1,408.1 million is an impairment loss on goodwill arising from discontinuance of the financial support of the holding company to Taizhou Mining’s operation for the generation of the originally expected synergy to the Group, which Taizhou Mining has to procure other source of financing instead of from the holding company for its financial year ended 31 March 2011 and onwards. Apex Minerals NL Apex The aforesaid other losses of approximately HK$26.5 million incurred by the Group is the net effect of other income of Taizhou Mining of approximately HK$3 million, impairment loss of approximately HK$5.4 million provided for the prepayment intended for the Henan Projects (as defined below) which the Company is now having its PRC lawyer to follow up on the case with the counterparty and loss of approximately HK$24.9 million arising from on partial disposal of the Group’s investment in Apex Minerals NL (“Apex”), a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Basic loss per share was approximately HK cents 11.94 for the year ended 31 March 2011 (2010: loss of HK cents 0.80). There will be no payment of dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 (2010: Nil). As at 31 March 2011, the Group had cash and cash equivalents and net current liabilities amounted to approximately HK$1.9 million and approximately HK$70.3 million (2010: HK$2.1 million and HK$82.8 million) respectively. The Group generally financed its operating activities with internally generated cash flow as well as borrowings as detailed in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements. Since inventories of the Group were pledged to one of the financiers of Taizhou Mining under the Operating Model, its inventories increased materially from approximately HK$0.7 million as at 31 March 2010 to approximately HK$24.5 million as at 31 March 2011. As at 31 March 2011, the current ratio is 0.50 (2010: 0.42). As at 31 March 2011, the Group’s gearing ratio was approximately 24% (31 March 2010: 9%), which was calculated based on total borrowings over total assets. As at 31 March 2011, the Group’s bank borrowings were secured by the mining right owned by the Group whereas its long term loans were secured by the inventories of the Group’s operating subsidiary, Taizhou Mining. Since the Group’s borrowings and its source of income are primarily denominated in Hong Kong dollars or Renminbi, the exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is minimal. During the year under view, the Group partially disposed of its investment in Apex, and realised a loss on disposal of approximately HK$24.9 million. Between 2009 and 2010, the Company entered into a series of memorandum of understanding and agreements with the vendors in relation to the Company’s proposed acquisition of equity interest in the target companies in Henan Province (the “Henan Projects”) and paid to the vendors earnest monies totaling HK$13.05 million. As at 31 March 2011, the Group had 124 employees (2010: 135) situated mainly in the PRC and Hong Kong. The Group’s emoluments policies are formulated based on industry practices and performance of individual employees. For the year ended 31 March 2011, the total staff costs (including directors’ emoluments) amounted to approximately HK$13.1 million (2010: HK$13.5 million). During the year ended 31 March 2011, no share option had been granted by the Company. Details of employees’ remuneration are set out in note 8 of this report.

During the year under review, the Group’s total expenditure for the mine development and mineral exploration amounted to approximately HK$136.5 million. During the year under review, the aggregate expenditure on the ore mining operation of the Group was approximately HK$4.8 million.

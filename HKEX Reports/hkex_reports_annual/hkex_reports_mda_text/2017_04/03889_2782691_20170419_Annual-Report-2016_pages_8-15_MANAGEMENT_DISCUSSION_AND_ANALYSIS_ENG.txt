The selling prices of the Group’s products are affected by the prices of their raw materials (principally corn kernels and corn starch), the demand and supply of each of the products and their respective substitutes in the market and the variety of product specifications. During the year ended 31 December 2016 (the “Year”), notwithstanding the continuous effort of the state government to stimulate economic growth and development, the economic environment in China continued to be challenging. Demand at home and abroad remained weak during the Year. Rising costs coupled with the depreciation of Renminbi (“RMB”) has dragged down Chinese exports trade figures by 7.7 per cent year-on-year. In addition, rising protectionism has added uncertainties to China’s exports performance during the Year. With respect to global corn market, according to the estimate from the USDA, global corn production for the year 2016/2017 reaches 1,040 million metric tonnes (“MT”). International corn price increased slightly to 425 US cents per bushel (equivalent to RMB1,160 per MT) (31 December 2015: 406 US cents per bushel) by the end of the Year. In the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “Mainland China”), corn harvest in 2016/17 maintained at similar level at 220 million MT (2015/16: approximately 225 million MT). As disclosed in the Company’s interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (the “2016 Interim Report”), in an official government document “Opinion on the implementation of the establishment of subsidy programme to corn producers” dated 19 June 2016, the State Government confirmed the abolition of the state procurement of corn in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the introduction of a direct subsidy programme in these provinces in the 2016/17 corn harvest season. The scheme has restored market approach in the price determination of agricultural products and brought stability to the purchasing price of corn in China. The average market price of corn kernels dropped to approximately RMB1,735 per MT (end of 2015: RMB2,023 per MT) by the end of 2016. In addition, the provincial governments in northeast China introduced direct subsidies to corn refiners which purchase local corn during the harvest months of 2016. For instance, Jilin provincial government and Liaoning provincial government offer subsidies of RMB200 and RMB100 respectively for qualified corn refiners for every MT of corn purchased locally during the period from October 2016 till the end of April 2017 and processed before June 2017. However, as the Group’s upstream operation in Changchun has been suspended for relocation during the Year and its Jinzhou site has been operating at low utilisation rate in most of the months during the Year, its contribution to the Group’s revenue is minimal. However, with the Jinzhou upstream corn refinery gradually increases its utilisation rate since December 2016, such benefits with respect to corn price movement are expected to be reflected in the Group’s performance in 2017. The normalised corn price in China coupled with the depreciation of RMB enhance the competitiveness of Chinese corn refined products and other downstream products. It is expected that China’s export trade performance will improve in 2017. As observed in the trade figures in January 2017, China’s export trade has shown signs of recovery and risen 7.9 per cent year-on-year to US$182.81 billion as a result of improved global demand. The improved outlook on China’s exports will help ease the pressure from overcapacity in the domestic market. As for the sugar market, decreased production in various major sugar producing regions has once boosted international sugar price to 23.90 US cents per pound (equivalent to RMB3,457 per MT) (2015: 16.16 US cents per pound, equivalent to RMB2,212 per MT) during the Year. Similar phenomenon has been noted in the PRC market – domestic cane sugar production dropped from 10.5 million MT to 9.0 million MT in 2015/16 harvest, with domestic sugar price once hit RMB7,119 per MT (2015: RMB5,518 per MT) during the Year. The increased sugar price in contrast with the decreased corn price has widened the cost difference between cane sugar and corn sweeteners, increasing customer’s incentive to switch to corn sweeteners. Although it is estimated that the World’s sugar production will raised from 165 million MT to 171 million MT approximately in 2016/17 harvest, there will still be shortage for the year 2017 with the World’s sugar consumption volume estimated at 174 million MT. As such, the outlook on sugar and sweetener market remains positive. Notwithstanding the fact that 2016 was still a year filled with challenges, the overall operating environment during the Year improved slightly. While the sweeteners market remains stable, changes in the upstream industry is expected to provide opportunities for corn refiners. The Group will continue to strengthen its market position leveraging on its brand name and further improve cost effectiveness through continuous research and development efforts to lower operating costs, at the same time optimising utilisation rate to improve operation efficiency. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 was subject to the disclaimer of opinion of the Auditor in the independent auditor’s report in the Company’s annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 (“2015 Annual Report”). Further to the management response and relevant remedial measures taken and to be taken by the management as set out in the paragraph headed “Update on Remedial Measures” in the 2015 Annual Report and the 2016 Interim Report, the management of the Company wishes to update the remedial measures taken or to be taken as follows. As detailed in the 2015 Annual Report, the Previous Financial Guarantee Contracts were not recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 because the Group was unable to obtain reliable financial information of a former major supplier of corn kernels of the Group, Changchun Dajincang Corn Procurement, Ltd. (“Dajincang” or the “Supplier”), for the professional valuer to conduct an accurate valuation. During the Year, as a result of similar difficulties encountered by the Group in 2015, no valuation as at 31 December 2016 could be proceeded. As disclosed in the joint announcement of the Company and GBT dated 8 August 2016 and the circular of the Company dated 6 September 2016, New Financial Guarantee Contracts were granted by a subsidiary of the Company to (Bank of China Weifeng International Branch) (“BOC”) to guarantee the obligations of the Supplier under the new supplier loan. As at the date of this report, BOC had not taken steps to enforce the New Financial Guarantee Contracts. While the Group continues to negotiate with BOC to release the Group from the New Financial Guarantee Contracts, the Group and BOC have also explored other alternatives in case the Supplier fails to repay the New Supplier Loan which will consequently trigger the Group’s obligations as the guarantors pursuant to the New Financial Guarantee Contracts including debt-equity swap. Subsequently, a debt-equity swap proposal has been submitted to the People’s Government of Jilin Province for approval in March 2017. As detailed in the 2015 Annual Report, an impairment assessment on the Group’s property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2014 and 2015 was performed by the Directors. As a result, except for buildings which were stated at revalued amounts, the property, plant and equipment in Jinzhou and Changchun were fully impaired. The Auditor was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of the Directors’ impairment assessment at 31 December 2014 and 2015. The management has engaged an independent professional qualified valuer to perform a valuation in order to assess the impairment on the Group’s property, plant and equipment in Jinzhou and Changchun as at 31 December 2016. The Auditor was satisfied with the impairment assessment of the Group’s property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2016. However, since the Auditor was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the Directors’ impairment assessment as at 31 December 2014 and 2015, the Auditor was unable to determine whether any adjustments to the property, plant and equipment together with related tax at 31 December 2015 were necessary, which may have a significant impact on the reversal of impairment loss and the related deferred tax effect recognised during the year ended 31 December 2016. In addition to the remedial actions as set out above, the management will continue to assess the valuation from time to time to ensure proper impairments are made. As such, it is expected that the disclaimer of the same nature would not appear in the final results for the year of 2017. With respect to the material uncertainty relating to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have expressed their views and outlined the steps that have been taken and to be taken to improve the Group’s financial position in note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements. Dependent on the successful and favourable outcomes of these steps, the Board, including the audit committee, is of the view that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern in foreseeable future. Please refer to note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements for details. Depending on successful and favorable outcomes of the proposed steps as set out in note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are of the view that the Company could operate as a going concern in the foreseeable future, and that the relevant disclaimer opinion may not appear in the final results for the year of 2017. Due to the decrease in sales volume and average selling prices, the Group’s consolidated revenue for the Year decreased by 39.6% to approximately HK$995.2 million (2015: HK$1,649.0 million). However, benefiting from the improved upstream market sentiment, the Group’s gross profit increased by 29.9% to approximately HK$104.3 million (2015: HK$80.3 million) year-on-year. On the other hand, the low utilisation rate of the Group’s production facilities in Jinzhou as a result of the intermittent production during the Year and the impairment of prepayment, deposits and other receivables of HK$230 million have dragged down the overall performance of the Group. As a result, the Group recorded a loss for the Year of approximately HK$162.4 million (2015: HK$753.8 million). In relation to the impairments of prepayments and other receivables in the amount of HK$229.7 million, such were impairment loss on the outstanding balance of the receivable from Dajincang, which comprised of certain prepayments and trade and other receivables that constituted the Relevant Assets. Subsequent to the termination of the Asset Disposal Agreement in March 2017, pursuant to which the receivable from Dajincang amounted to HK$223 million constituted part of the Relevant Assets, the Directors have assessed the recoverability of the receivable from Dajincang based on past collection history and the latest unaudited financial information of Dajincang. The Directors determined that the amount is not recoverable. As such, further impairment loss on the outstanding balance of the receivable from Dajincang of approximately HK$217 million was recognised during the Year. (Sales amount: HK$392.4 million (2015: HK$847.7 million)) (Gross profit: HK$21.0 million (2015: HK$6.3 million)) During the Year, the revenue and gross loss of corn procurement business amounted to approximately HK$64.3 million and HK$0.1 million (2015: HK$292.4 million and HK$0.9 million) respectively. With respect to the Group’s corn refinery business, the sales volume of corn starch and other corn refined products were approximately 99,000 MT (2015: 83,000 MT) and 40,000 MT (2015: 50,000 MT) respectively. Internal consumption of corn starch was approximately 28,000 MT (2015: 30,000 MT), which was mainly used as the raw material for production in the Group’s Shanghai production site. The average selling prices of corn starch and other corn refined products decreased by 27.9% to approximately HK$2,396 per MT (2015: HK$3,322 per MT) and 9.0% to approximately HK$2,242 per MT (2015: HK$2,464 per MT) respectively during the Year. Notwithstanding the fact that the Group’s upstream corn refinery in Jinzhou has been operating at low utilisation rate during the Year, it has been benefiting from the agricultural subsidies from the provincial government for every MT of corn purchased and processed since the fourth quarter of the Year and the lower raw material cost as a result of the PRC agricultural policy reform. Consequently, the corn starch and other corn refined products segments recorded a gross profit margin of 8.5% (2015: 5.8%) and 1.0% (2015: gross loss margin of 9.3%) respectively during the Year. The Group’s upstream business has been improving since the last quarter of 2016 as the agricultural policy reforms gradually took effect. Since the upstream operation serves as a feedstock for the Group’s downstream production, it has strategic value to the Group’s operation. As such, in response to the challenging environment, the Group will closely monitor market movements and optimise its production scale from time to time. (Sales amount: HK$405.3 million (2015: HK$523.0 million)) (Gross profit: HK$66.9 million (2015: HK$49.8 million)) During the Year, revenue of corn syrup decreased by 22.5% to approximately HK$405.3 million (2015: HK$523.0 million). It was mainly attributable to the decrease in average selling price of corn syrup by 18.7% to approximately HK$2,965 per MT (2015:HK$3,646 per MT) as a result of the substantial decrease in corn starch price during the Year. Nevertheless, the cost advantage of corn sweeteners over cane sugar has enhanced the performance of the Group’s downstream segments. As such, the corn syrup segment recorded a gross profit of approximately HK$66.9 million (2015: HK$49.8 million), representing a 34.3% increase compared to the previous year, with a gross profit margin of 16.5% (2015: 9.5%). (Sales amount: HK$186.8 million (2015: HK$278.3 million)) (Gross profit: HK$15.5 million (2015: HK$24.2 million)) No sales of crystallised glucose was recorded during the Year (2015: Nil) due to the suspension of the Group’s Changchun production facilities. During the Year, sales volume of corn syrup solid, all of which was maltodextrin, decreased by approximately 14.0% to 74,000 MT (2015: 86,000 MT). As the average selling price of maltodextrin dropped by 22.4% to approximately HK$2,519 per MT (2015: HK$3,245 per MT), the revenue of maltodextrin decreased by 32.9% to approximately HK$186.8 million (2015: HK$278.3 million). During the Year, corn syrup solid segment recorded a gross profit of approximately HK$15.5 million (2015: HK$24.2 million) with a gross profits margin of 8.3% (2015: 8.7%). (Sales amount: HK$10.7 million (2015: Nil)) (Gross profit: HK$0.9 million (2015: Nil)) During the Year, the Group has entered into a master sales agreement with the GBT Group for the marketing and sale of the lysine and other corn refined products of the GBT Group in the Huadong Region. The trading segment recorded a gross profit of approximately HK$0.9 million (2015: Nil) with a gross profit margin of 8.4% (2015: Nil). The sale of lysine and other corn refined products has created synergistic effects to the Group’s business and allowed the Group to offer better product mix to its customers. During the Year, the Group exported approximately 46,000 MT (2015: 41,000 MT) of upstream corn refined products and approximately 2,000 MT (2015: 200 MT) of corn sweeteners; their export sales amounted to approximately HK$86.2 million (2015: HK$90.0 million) and HK$5.1 million (2015: HK$0.2 million) respectively, together representing 9.2% (2015: 5.5%) of the Group’s total revenue. Other income and gains, operating expenses, finance costs and income tax credit/(expense) During the Year, other income of the Group decreased to HK$14.8 million (2015: HK$38.0 million). Such decrease was mainly attributable to the reversal of indemnity for breach of contract amounting to HK$21.9 million during During the Year, the selling and distribution costs decreased by 4.2% to approximately HK$84.0 million (2015: HK$87.7 million), representing 8.4% (2015: 5.3%) of the Group’s revenue. Such decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in the Group’s sales volume. In 2015, expenses in relation to the idle facilities in Changchun subsequent to the suspension of operation was classified under Other expenses. During the Year, the relevant expenses were reclassified under Administrative expenses. As such, administrative expenses increased by 14.6% to approximately HK$115.3 million (2015: HK$100.6 million), representing 11.6% (2015: 6.1%) of the Group’s revenue. During the Year, the Company has engaged a professional valuer to perform a valuation to assess the impairment on certain subsidiaries machineries in Jinzhou and Changchun. As such, a reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment amounted to HK$138.9 million was recognised for the Year. During the Year, the Group recorded an impairment of prepayments and other receivables of HK$229.7 million, which was mainly attributable to the impairment loss on the outstanding balance of the receivable from Dajincang. Subsequent to the termination of the Asset Disposal Agreement (wherein the receivable from Dajincang amounted to HK$222.6 million was included) as disclosed in the joint announcement by the Company and GBT dated 2 March 2017, the Directors have assessed the recoverability of the receivable from Dajincang based on past collection history and the latest unaudited financial information of Dajincang, and determined that the amount is not recoverable. As such, further impairment loss on the outstanding balance of the receivable from Dajincang of approximately HK$217.4 million was recognised during the Year. During the Year, the Group’s Jinzhou production facilities have resumed production. Consequently, other expenses of the Group which included expenses reallocated from cost of sales, such as depreciation and direct labour cost as a result of the idle capacity decreased to approximately HK$31.8 million (2015: HK$127.8 million). During the Year, finance costs of the Group decreased to approximately HK$48.5 million (2015: HK$65.4 million) as a result of the decrease in the average interest rate to approximately 5.8% (2015: 6.8%). Income tax credit/(expense) Due to the reversal of temporary differences, the Group recorded a deferred tax credit of approximately HK$93.7 million (2015: deferred tax expense of HK$0.8 million) during the Year; meanwhile, two subsidiaries in the PRC incurred net profit and were subject to the PRC enterprise income tax of approximately HK$1.6 million (2015: HK$5.7 million). As a result, the Group recorded income tax credit of HK$92.1 million during the Year (2015: income tax expense: HK$6.6 million). With the improved operating environment since the late second half of the Year, coupled with the Group’s strategy to optimise the level of operation and a recognised brand name, the Group’s net loss was narrowed to approximately HK$162.4 million (2015: HK$753.8 million) during the Year. As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s bank borrowings amounted to approximately HK$808.3 million (31 December 2015: HK$894.0 million), all of which (31 December 2015: 100.0%) was denominated in Renminbi. The average interest rate during the Year decreased to approximately 5.8% (2015: 6.8%) per annum as a result of the decrease in the PRC interest rate. Considering the management’s continuous efforts in monitoring the cash flow of the Company and in maintaining good relationship with banks, the Group has not experienced any difficulties in renewing the existing banking facilities as of the date of this report. Credit terms, normally 30 to 90 days, are granted to customers, depending on their credit worthiness and business relationships with the Group. During the Year, the resumption of the Jinzhou operation which normally grants a longer credit period to their customers and the acceptance of customer’s settlement by bills in Shanghai area with a longer settlement period have increased the trade and bills receivables to HK$193.0 million (2015: 167.6 million). As such, the trade receivables turnover days increased to 71 days (31 December 2015: 37 days) during the Year. During the Year, trade payables turnover days increased to approximately 58 days (31 December 2015: 46 days) as part of the cash flow management. As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s inventory turnover days increased to 46 days (31 December 2015: 37 days). Such increase was mainly attributable to increase in raw material — corn kernels as a result of resumption of operation in Jinzhou. The current ratio as at 31 December 2016 decreased to approximately 0.4 (31 December 2015: 0.9) and the quick ratio decreased to 0.3 (31 December 2015: 0.8), due to the reallocation of non-current assets held for sale to the property, plant and equipment and prepaid land lease payments during the Year. Gearing ratio in terms of net debts (i.e. net balance between bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalents) to equity was approximately 5,771.0% (31 December 2015: 450.9%). To improve the financial position of the Group, the Company has adopted several strategic actions as mentioned in “3. material uncertainty relating to going concern” under the section headed “Update on remedial measures” in this report. Most of the operations of the Group were carried out in the PRC in which transactions were denominated in Renminbi, while export sales accounting for 9.2% of the Group’s revenue in which most of these transactions were denominated in US Dollars. The management of the Company have been closely monitoring the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations in Renminbi. However, considering the depreciation of Renminbi during the Year, the Company are of the view that there is no material unfavourable exposure to foreign exchange fluctuation. Therefore, the Group currently does not intend to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations in Renminbi. The Group will constantly review the economic situation, development of the Group’s business segments and its overall foreign exchange risk profile, and will consider appropriate hedging measures in future as and when necessary. Termination of the disposal of lands and buildings in Changchun and disposal of accounts receivables and Reference is made to the joint announcement of the Company and GBT dated 2 March 2017, in relation to, among others, the termination of the Property Disposal Agreement and the Asset Disposal Agreement. Following the approval of the disposal of the Relevant Properties and the Relevant Assets by the shareholders of the Company and GBT on 21 June 2016, the relevant members of the Group has been actively working with the Former Purchaser in relation to the fulfillment of the conditions precedent and completion arrangement of the contemplated disposals. Notwithstanding the effort made by the Group, certain conditions precedent as contemplated under the Property Disposal Agreement were yet to be fulfilled. In December 2016, the Former Purchaser proposed to terminate the Property Disposal Agreement. On the other hand, although all conditions precedent under the Asset Disposal Agreement have been fulfilled, and the completion of the Asset Disposal Agreement is not conditional upon the completion of the Property Disposal Agreement, the Former Purchaser also proposed to terminate the Asset Disposal Agreement. The Group has sought PRC legal advice of their rights under the Property Disposal Agreement and the Asset Disposal Agreement and were advised that if the Group initiate legal proceedings against the Former Purchaser, such proceedings will be time-consuming, costly and the Relevant Properties may be subject to seizure by the court during the legal proceedings. Having considered the uncertainties involved during the legal proceedings and the financial conditions of the Group, the Board considers that it is in the economic interest of the Group to focus their resources on their business and operation rather than incurring time and costs in legal proceedings and that an early termination of the Property Disposal Agreement and the Asset Disposal Agreement would also enable the Group to explore other means to dispose of the Relevant Properties as early as possible. Reference is made to the announcement of the Company dated 23 March 2017. In light of change in shareholding structure of the controlling shareholder of GBT, the controlling shareholder of the Company, the management of the Company has also undergone change. With effect from 23 March 2017, Mr. Wang Jian, Mr. Fu Qiang and Ms. Zhang Yaohui have resigned as Directors, and Mr. Zhang Zihua has been appointed as a Director. In order to maintain the competitiveness of the Group, the Group will strive to maintain its market share, diversify its product mix and enhance its capability in developing high value-added products and new applications through in-house research and development efforts and strategic business alliance with prominent international market leaders. In the short run, the Group will take opportunity of the relocation of its production facilities to the productions site of the Group in Xinglongshan, Changchun (the “Xinglongshan Site”) to re-adjust its product mix and capacity to adapt to market changes, and at the same time, enhance operation efficiency through continuous research and development efforts to lower operating costs. The relocation plan of the Group will be financed by the Group’s internal resources, and the management of the Company is of the view that the existing technology know-how of the Group is sufficient for the relocation of production facilities. Phase one of the relocation of the sweetener production facility to the Xinglongshan Site is in progress. Trial run is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2017. In the long run, the Group will continue to strengthen its market position by leveraging on its brand name and add value to the current product mix through the introduction of new high value-added products. The Group will also consider the possibility of diversification of business to ensure sustainable development of the Group in longer term. With respect to the financial position of the Group, the management will endeavor to overcome the challenges and adopt a prudent approach in business development. As at 31 December 2016, the Group has approximately 1,130 (31 December 2015: 1,250) full time employees in Hong Kong and the PRC. The Group appreciates the correlation between human resources and its success, and recognises the value of human resources management as a source of competitive advantage in the increasing turbulent environment. The Group places great emphasis on the selection and recruitment of new staff, on-the- job training, appraisal and rewards of its employees to align employees’ performance with the Group’s strategies. The Company also acknowledges the contribution of its employees and strives to maintain remuneration packages and career development opportunities to retain current employees. Remuneration packages include discretionary bonuses payable on a merit basis, which are in line with industrial practice. Staff benefits provided by the Group include mandatory funds, insurance schemes and performance related bonuses.

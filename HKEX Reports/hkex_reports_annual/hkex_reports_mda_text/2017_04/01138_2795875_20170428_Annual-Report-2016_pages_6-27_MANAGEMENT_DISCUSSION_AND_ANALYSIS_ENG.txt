Annual Report 2016 In 2016, the international oil transportation market suffered from various adverse factors such as the slowdown of global economic growth, the sluggish increase in international oil prices, OPEC continuing to consider reducing oil production, and the significant increase in new transportation capacity, while overall transportation prices appeared to have started on a downward trend. For the very large crude carrier (“VLCC”) market, the annual average transportation price of the three major traditional routes (the Middle East - Far East TD3, Middle East - US Gulf TD1, West Africa - China TD15) dropped more than 30% month-on-month, while for the international white oil market, the annual average transportation price of the three types of vessels (LR2、LR1、MR) in the three traditional routes (Middle East - Japan TC1, the Middle East - Japan TC5, West India - Japan TC12) declined 38%, 39% and 38% month-on- month respectively. With the continuous implementation of the oil and gas reform, domestic crude oil import rights and imported crude oil usage rights have been expanded, and local oil refineries have recorded higher operating rates. Pursuant to the statistics of the customs department, import of crude oil in China increased by 13.6% to 381 million tonnes in 2016. Domestic transportation demand for crude oil in 2016 bloomed amid a healthy supply of crude oil. In 2016, domestic demand for natural gas increased, leading to a restoration of growth in volume of LNG import. Since international prices of LNG was hovering at a low level in line with crude oil prices, the decline in import cost of LNG favoured the import market to a certain extent. In 2016, import volume of LNG in China increased by 32.97% to 26.1540 million tonnes year-on-year. Annual Report 2016 In 2016, the Group underwent a major asset restructuring. As at 30 June 2016, the Group completed the disposal of dry bulk shipping segment and the acquisition of Dalian Tanker. The Group is committed to implementing the overall direction of “business innovation and efficiency, deepening of reform and innovative development”, further strengthening the strategy of “global operation and sale under one brand”, and holding to the ideology of “leading globally by safe operation and sale”. The Group actively developed innovative business models and strived to integrate the outcomes of reform and reorganisation. As a result, the Group was able to exert scale and synergistic effects at the outset and achieve desired results in business, reform, development, innovation, risk control and other aspects. In 2016, the volume of cargo shipped by the continuing operations of the Group increased by 0.76% year- on-year to 104 million tonnes, while the transport turnover decreased by 4.16% year-on-year to 348.08 billion tonne-nautical miles. Revenue derived from the continuing operations decreased by 9.81% year-on-year to RMB9.658 billion, while operating costs decreased by 7.31% year-on-year to RMB6.957 billion. In 2016, the volume of cargo shipped by the discontinued operation of the Group was 63 million tonnes, while the transport turnover was 165.954 billion tonne-nautical miles. Revenue derived from the discontinued operation was RMB2.862 billion, while operating costs was RMB2.775 billion. The profit attributable to owners of the Company was RMB1.934 billion, and the basic and diluted earnings per share was RMB47.97 cents. Annual Report 2016 In 2016, overall details of the Group’s principal operations by products transported and geographical regions were as follows: Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) Annual Report 2016 For international oil shipment, the Group 1) increased the proportion of its leasing business so as to lock in gains and avoid the risk of market downturn. The current proportion of the Group’s VLCCs that are leased out is approximately 30%, which allows the Group to better ensure that a profit can be realised; 2) continued to enhance its market analysis and estimation abilities, while at the same time focusing on long-haul routes at the height of the market to lock in the gains, and focusing on short-haul routes and on adjusting vessel positions as the market slumped, so as to constantly enhance its ability to adapt to market fluctuations; 3) achieved transportation of total import of five major domestic oil companies of 44.13 million tonnes in 2016, accounting for 52.1% of the total volume of the Group. The Group continued to play the core role in “domestic transportation of domestic oil” to consolidate and improve the proportion of basic sources, so as to effectively avoid market fluctuations; and 4) actively promoted the construction of overseas outlets of British companies and US companies, and completed the business integration of Hong Kong companies, laying a solid foundation for the Group’s strategy of “Global operation and sale under one brand”. For domestic oil shipment, the Group 1) capitalised on a linkage advantage of domestic and international trade market, and strived to improve its operating results. Since the domestic market performed significantly better than the international market, the Group turned all crude oil tankers for domestic and foreign trade to domestic transportation; 2) adhered to a strategy of targeting major customers and maintaining a high proportion of COA contracts. In addition to the renewal of COA contracts with its original major customers, the Group entered into a cooperation in domestic transshipment with China National United Oil Corporation and established a winter/summer transportation price differentiation mechanism with several large local refineries in Shandong so as to stabilise supply from local refineries; and 3) promoted business model innovation, improved the operating efficiency of vessels and customer service standards. The Group strengthened “customer thinking”, implemented a pilot “customer management system”, provided one-on-one personal service to customers to promote the innovation in norm of domestic transportation. In 2016, the Group completed a domestic oil shipping volume of approximately 16.38 billion tonne-nautical miles, representing a 0.31% increase year-on-year, with a 5.16% increase year-on-year in transportation income to approximately RMB2,568.02 million and a 0.8% year-on-year increase in gross profit rate to 42.6%. The Group’s market share in domestic oil shipment market remained at around 55%. Annual Report 2016 In 2016, the Group completed an international shipping volume of approximately 331.57 billion tonne- nautical miles of oil, representing a decrease by approximately 4.37% year-on-year (mainly due to the leasing out of some previously self-owned vessels), with a 14.71% year-on-year decrease in transportation income to approximately RMB6.969 billion and a decrease of approximately RMB631 million by 27.32% year-on-year in gross profit (gross profit margin being 24.10%) to approximately RMB1.679 billion. In 2016, the Group completed an oil shipping volume of approximately 347.94 billion tonne-nautical miles of oil, representing a year-on-year decrease of approximately 4.16%, and recorded an operating revenue of approximately RMB9.537 billion, representing a year-on-year decrease of approximately 10.14%.

At the end of the Reporting Period, the Group and the joint ventures had a total of 23 LNG vessels with approximately 3.98 million cubic meters under construction and expected to be delivered before the end of 2020. Annual Report 2016 In 2016, the Group conscientiously implemented the requirements of the board of directors (the “Directors”) of the Company (the “Board”) on the enhancement of management and the increase of efficiency and cost reduction, so as to further emphasise the strategic positioning of “cost as the winning factor”. The Group started with the management of operations and overall budget in its effort to strengthen cost control, and was able to effectively control various costs and expenses. In 2016, the principal operating cost of the continuing operations of the Group amounted to a total of approximately RMB6.957 billion, down by 7.31% year-on- year, indicating that effective cost control ensured a significant improvement in the operating profit of the Group. The following table sets forth the constitution of costs of the principal operations of the Group: Increase/ (decrease) ratio in 2016 Fuel costs were the main cost of the Group. In 2016, the Group fully exploited the post restructuring integrated management and control efficiency of COSCO Shipping Group’s operation platform. Through strengthening cooperation with suppliers and traders, the Group improved its market estimation mechanism and took advantage of the slump in international fuel prices to lock in fuel costs. At the same time, through maximising cruising speed efficiency, the Group aimed to control cargo oil heating, washing, filling, ballast water replacement and other technical aspects and improve fuel efficiency. In 2016, fuel costs of the continuing operations of the Group were approximately RMB1.396 billion, down by 29.57% year-on-year, accounting for 20.06% of the operating cost.

The guarantee period is limited to that of the lease period, which is twenty years. Annual Report 2016 (v) On 9 March 2013, one of the Group’s cargo vessels “CSB Talent” had a broken bollard caused by strong wind at the dock and collided with several parked vessels nearby, which resulted in damage of the floating dock and other facilities. In March 2014, claims on damage caused by the collision amounted to an aggregate of RMB173,865,000. Since the Company had been insured with PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited (Guangzhou Branch) and The London Steam Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association Limited, all compensation will be borne by the insurance companies. As at 31 December 2016, such contingent liability has been removed as a result of the operation discontinued on 30 June 2016.

The guarantee was derecognised on 30 June 2016 resulting from the discontinued operation. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to United States Dollar (“USD”) and Hong Kong Dollar (“HKD”) against RMB. Foreign currency risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. As at 31 December 2016, if USD and HKD had weakened or strengthened by 1% against RMB with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been RMB8,957,000 lower/ higher (2015: RMB12,951,000 higher/lower), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of USD and HKD denominated cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables and borrowings. Annual Report 2016 Other than the deposits placed with banks and financial institutions and loan receivables, the Group has no other significant interest-bearing assets. As the average interest rates applied to the deposits are relatively low, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group is not exposed to any significant interest rate risk for these assets held as at 31 December 2016 and 2015. The Group’s exposures to interest rate risk also arises from its borrowings. Loan receivables and borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Management monitors the capital market conditions and certain interest rate swap agreements with banks have been used to achieve optimum ratio between fixed and floating rates borrowings. As at 31 December 2016, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Group’s post-tax profit for the year would have been RMB150,432,000 (2015: RMB267,561,000) lower/higher, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest income on loan receivables and interest expenses on borrowings issued at floating rates. In 2016, the Group has achieved further improvement in its fleet expansion. In 2016, the cash outflow from investment activities of the Group was approximately RMB11.72 billion which has been paid for construction of new vessels, acquisition of a subsidiary and capital increases into joint ventures of the Company, including capital expenditure of approximately RMB4.23 billion paid for the purchase of new vessels by the Group. In terms of fleet expansion, 4 new tankers with a total capacity of approximately 746,000 DWT and 1 new LNG vessel with capacity of approximately 174,000 cubic metres have been delivered for use in As at 31 December 2016, the composition of the Group’s fleet is as follows: (years) LNG vessel (note) Note: The carrying capacity of LNG vessel is measured in cubic metres. Annual Report 2016 In 2017, the delivery of tanker transportation capacity reached a cycle peak. The situation of oversupply will further intensify, and as a result, the international oil transport market situation is still grim. However, the forthcoming implementation of the Ballast Water Treatment Convention during the year may lead to the temporary withdrawal of some of the transportation capacity from the market. To a further extent, this may lead to the result that the U.S. shale oil and gas revolution will promote the formation of the new pattern of oil and gas resources from the East and the West. The international crude oil market will form the two major export centres of North America and the Middle East. Asian countries such as China and India will experience rapid growth in energy consumption. Asia will become the focus of global energy trade. The adjustment of the global oil and gas trade and transport pattern has provided an opportunity for us to optimise the market structure, the cargo source structure, the route structure and the customer mix. Affected by factors like production reduction in marine oil and pipelining of transshipment oil, the domestic oil shipment market is expected to suffer under shrinking domestic trade sources. The oil import rights expansion policy for domestic local oil refineries remains unchanged, which should boost demand for imported crude oil among domestic refineries. Overall, the domestic oil shipment market is expected to remain stable. The fundamental circumstances of the LNG shipping market is unlikely to improve. In addition, as the fleet size is expected to grow by 13%, transportation prices are expected to remain low. Although the LNG transportation market appears sluggish in the short term, its medium and long term prospects are promising. Currently, there are construction plans for liquefaction capacity of 152 million tonnes globally. As more LNG plants commence operation in 2018, LNG trade is expected to thrive, and the oversupply in the LNG shipment market is expected to improve. In the face of a complex market environment, the Group intends to adhere to the “strategic leadership and innovation drive” and “maintenance of global leading position in fleet size, industrial leading position in business structure, global leading position in safety marketing and business model” strategies under the leadership of the Board, so as to enhance the risk resistant ability, sustainable development and core competitiveness of the Group. Annual Report 2016 In 2017, the Group expects to add 13 new oil tankers with a total tonnage of 2,360,000 DWT of shipping capacity, and 3 new LNG vessels with a total shipping capacity of 520,000 cubic metres. It is anticipated that the following will be put into use throughout the year: 113 oil tankers of 17.02 million DWT, 4 LPG vessels of 10,000 DWT, and 4 LNG vessels of 700,000 cubic metres. Based on the market conditions of the domestic and international shipping industry in 2017, and taking into account the delivery of new vessels, the Group’s major operating goals in 2017 are as follows: shipment turnover volume of 389.6 billion tonne-nautical miles; operating revenue of RMB10.2 billion; operating costs of RMB7.5 billion. In response to the current market environment, the Group will adhere to the following tasks: A. Commitment to outperforming the market, leading the innovation in business model and For the international oil shipment market, the Group will achieve a reasonable distribution of the fleet and forecast the shipping price scientifically, so as to grasp the periodic peak of the market by taking mutual reference to the prediction of shipping price and the transportation volume and hence to realise the transition of experience management to scientific management. It will continue to strengthen safety marketing and promote the contracting of the COA. Advantages of overseas outlets in terms of location, information and platform will be utilised for expanding the western market in depth and establishing excellent triangular routes to realise the diversification of supply structure, customer structure and route structure. The Group will seriously study the proportion among domestic shipping and third country transportation, leasing and self-operation, so as to enlarge the extent of leasing in market bloom to lock in basic income and reduce the exposure risk. Also, new trend of refined oil export will be in high profile, with proper overall arrangement in advance to ensure maximum operating efficiency. Annual Report 2016 For the domestic oil shipment market, the Group will continue to commit to becoming a leader in innovation of business model, and work hard for the continuous growth in the domestic market. The leading edge in business structure will be fully utilised for providing customers with comprehensive logistics solutions. On the one hand, various innovative business cooperation models will be promoted to improve transportation quality, operational efficiency and vessel profitability. On the other hand, communication with the core customers who have the edge on research and estimation for the upstream market will be strengthened. The Group will also understand the market trends from the supply side and strengthen the business cooperation with local refineries in accordance with the implementation of the national mixed ownership reform and the further unlashing of the quota of imported crude oil, so as to grasp the changes in market demand to seize market opportunities. For the LNG transportation, the Group will broaden its thinking and establish extensive contacts with major international LNG sellers to seek cooperation opportunities for third-party LNG projects. At the same time, the development of domestic private shippers will also be emphasised to formulate corresponding project intervention strategies to promote the development and expansion of LNG business. B. By adhering to the strategy of placing cost as the priority, the Group puts great effort in cost Currently, the international oil price is rising and fluctuating. The Group will continue to implement the fuel price locking mechanism to improve the accuracy of estimation of the trend of oil prices, with target reference value determined scientifically, so as to stay in line with the market pace by developing long, medium and short term operation plans. Meanwhile, reasonable speed will be determined for best efficiency and lean management on different parts of fuel consumption will be comprehensively strengthened to control fuel consumption. C. By strengthening capital management, the Group strives to reduce the capital cost Composition of the liabilities will be analysed in depth, and adjust the currency structure according to exchange rate of USD and RMB. In addition, capital cost will be lowered. The Group will also coordinate the planned stock funds, so as to ensure a reasonable level of cash flow. D. By adhering to innovation drive, the Group promotes leapfrog development in fleet scale to Relationship between supply and demand in the shipping market and the trend of changes in asset prices will be in high profile. The Group will also explore to a greater extent the possibility of participating in the upstream and downstream business chain, so as to further enhance the overall risk resistant capacity. Annual Report 2016 E.

In the first half of 2016, the Group experienced a trough in this segment of the business as a result of a series of reasons including the country’s replacement of business tax with value-added tax. The Group then proactively adjusted its strategy in the second half of 2016 and launched high-end customised services that was met with big demand by the market. At the same time, the Group also obtained tax related projects from regions outside of Jiangsu Province, including Qingdao, Shenzhen and Guizhou Province during the period under review.

With the completion of the change in tax regime in the beginning of the second half of 2016, enterprises’ demand in tax software products resumed to a normal growth in the second half of the year, which helped to significantly improve the Group’s revenue generated from tax software and related services from just a marginal growth in the first half.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, revenue generated from system integration solutions segment amounted to RMB 48.8 million, representing an increase of approximately 8.0% as compared to RMB 45.2 million for the same period in 2015.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the Group’s total revenue during the period under review. The Group’s segment results margin decreased from approximately 56.5% in the year ended 31 December 2015 to approximately 53.8% in the year ended 31 December 2016, primarily due to the increase in amortisation of development cost under the intensifying investment for developing new products, especially in carbon management solutions.

For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group’s administrative and general expenses decreased by approximately 2.9% to approximately RMB 38.5 million, as compared with approximately RMB 39.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Group’s income tax expenses decreased from approximately RMB 30.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 to approximately RMB 29.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2016.

An applicable tax rate of 15% was used for the corresponding period in 2015 as the application for the same “Key Software Enterprise under the National Plan” had not yet been approved at the then relevant time in 2015.

During the year under review, the Group recorded an exchange loss of approximately RMB 56,000 (31 December 2015: exchange loss of approximately RMB 410,000).

The Group will continue to closely monitor and manage its exposure to fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and make appropriate arrangement as and when necessary.

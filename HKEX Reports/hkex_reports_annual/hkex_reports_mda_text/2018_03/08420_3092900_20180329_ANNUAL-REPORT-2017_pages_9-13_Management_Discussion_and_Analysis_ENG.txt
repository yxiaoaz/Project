The Group is a well-established ICT solution provider headquartered in Singapore focusing on the provision of cyber infrastructure and cyber security solutions. Established in 2002, the Group started as a system integration service provider providing services to telecommunications service providers. Having gradually diversified its ICT services, the Group is now a regional provider of cyber infrastructure solutions in Southeast Asia. By working with various technology vendors, the Group acquired the experience and expertise to evolve to an ICT solution provider. Drawing upon its R&D capability, the Group successfully developed its technologies to provide cyber security solutions. The shares of the Company were successfully listed on GEM on 16 June 2017 by way of public offer. 150,000,000 public offer shares were issued at HK$0.48 per share pursuant to the offer of the public offer shares for subscription in Hong Kong (the “Public Offer”). The proceeds received from the Public Offer have strengthened the Group’s cash flow and the Group will implement its future plans and business strategies as set out in the section headed “Statement of Business Objectives and Use of Proceeds” in the prospectus dated 6 June 2017 (the “Prospectus”). In 2017, the Group established new companies in Hong Kong and the PRC to embrace new opportunities from the increase in the demand of information infrastructure system enhancement and upgrade along with The 13th Five-Year National Informatisation Plan (“ ” ) as promulgated by the State Council of the PRC in December 2016. The Group also accepted the options to acquire two properties located in Singapore for the development of new Group’s headquarter and R&D centre and such transactions were completed on 9 January 2018 and 14 February 2018 respectively. The Group will strengthen itself as an all-rounded ICT solution provider in Asia Pacific region by investing substantially in the R&D team for the development of new products and enhancement of the existing products and services continuously for potential customers. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the reportable segment results (Adjusted EBITDA) (i.e. “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation”) in cyber infrastructure solutions and cyber security solutions were approximately US$2,202,000 (2016: approximately US$891,000) and approximately US$2,168,000 (2016: approximately US$1,985,000) respectively. The substantial increase in the amount under cyber infrastructure solutions was due to the consulting service in the PRC. Regarding the amount under cyber security solutions, the increase in the amount was mainly due to the fulfillment of the remaining contract sum of the client based in Malaysia. During the year of 2017, the Group’s revenue from external customers based in Malaysia, Philippines and the PRC accounted for 86% of the total Group’s revenue. The Group expects the demand of the Group’s services and products from the clients based in these countries, especially the PRC, will remain strong in the future. In order to embrace the emerging market in the PRC, the Group leveraged on the technologies, technical skills and professionals, which are considered to be mature in Singapore, to provide consulting service in cyber infrastructure projects. The Group considered that consulting service as a stepping stone and the pilot project for further development in the PRC. The Group will continue to develop and strengthen the team as well as the sales network in the PRC for tendering cyber infrastructure projects in the future. The Group is deeply rooted in the Southeast Asia cyber infrastructure sector with its strength lying in the provision of cyber infrastructure solutions to internet services providers and with its customers are mainly located in the Southeast Asia. The directors of the Company believe that the emerging markets in the Southeast Asia will provide the Group with vast potential business opportunities. To further increase our market shares and brand visibility, the Group will continue to focus on the market of the Southeast Asia by leveraging on its established strengths and reputations. Subject to the feasibility and market study, the Group will expand its cyber security solutions business into Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Looking forward, the Group expects that the cyber infrastructure solutions market and cyber security solution market will grow continuously. The steady growth of developing economies in the Asia Pacific region will continue to attract considerable multinational enterprises and foreign investments. More organisations are keen to equip themselves with proper cyber infrastructure for international communication and information interaction so as to safeguard their interests. In addition, it urges enterprises or governments to manage the data and information delivered over the internet and to enhance cyber security because of an increase in information leakage, internet content management risks and cyber-crimes. The Group believes that its listing status along with its strong R&D capabilities in developing technologies and solutions, diversified geographical reach and established customer base would enhance its corporate profile and benefit brand image among its existing and potential customers. The Group will benefit from an increasing demand for cyber infrastructure and cyber security solutions in the market.

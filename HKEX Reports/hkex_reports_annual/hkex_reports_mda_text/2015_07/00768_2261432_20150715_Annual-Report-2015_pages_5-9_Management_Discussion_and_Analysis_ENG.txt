P.4 For the year ended 31st March, 2015, UBA Investments Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) recorded a profit attributable to equity holders of approximately HK$67 million (2014: loss HK$3.4 million) and of which a HK$0.25 million (2014: HK$6.5 million) impairment loss was made in relation to available-for-sales financial assets. The earnings per share was HK$0.0631(2014: loss per share of HK$0.0032). Turnover increasing 1.76 times from HK$188.3 million to HK$330.9 million in the corresponding period was resulted from the continuous proactive investment strategy adopted by the management and consistence with the increasing transaction volume in Hang Seng Index as compared with last year. The Group recorded a profit before impairment loss and unrealized gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss was around HK$25.2 million (2014: HK$6.7 million), which was mainly attributable to the realized gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and dividend income. As at 31st March, 2015, the net assets of the Group were approximately HK$172.1 million (2014: HK$105.9 million). During the year, the Company took the advantage of the Shanghai- Hong Kong Stock Connect Programme which commenced since the mid of November 2014. The Company started to increase the turnover by trading more listed securities which were beneficial by this programme, including around HK$200 million turnover related to bank sector. As at 31st March, 2015, the Group’s investment portfolio was well diversified and comprised of different sector of businesses which including telecommunication service, transportation, retail businesses, properties and banking, etc. in which the available-for-sales financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss were approximately HK$20 million and HK$104 million respectively (2014: HK$23 million and HK$73 million respectively). In 2014, the global as well as local economy were full of challenges and opportunities partly due to the U.S. Quantitative Easing Three scheme (“QE3”), the nearly zero lending rates suggested by the Chief of European Central Bank (“ECB”), the Greece’s debt default and the sharp drop in oil prices. As the U.S. growth remains tepid and slow recoveries, the inflation gauge “Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (“PCE”) was always keeping below 2%, which indicated the extremely low interest rate environment will be maintained for a long period of time although QE3 officially ended in late October 2014. This enhanced investors’ confidence in US equity markets and led to Dow Jones Index rebound around 7.9% from 16,530 on 1st April, to 17,828 at end of November 2014. At the same time, the ECB Chief Mario Draghi P.5 Annual Report 2015 (“Draghi”) keeping the lending rate to nearly zero, cutting the interest rate and lower the deposit facility rate in mid 2014 also stimulated the European equity markets. However, in mid of December in 2014, the U.S. and European markets triggered sharp drop after the wake of a widely unexpected huge decline in oil price and worries about the possible debt default and political uncertainty in Greece. The Dow Jones Index slumped 4.3% to 17,068 on 16th December, 2014. Finally, the investors expected the rate hike will not come so rapid and therefore led the Index rebounded over 5% to 17,983 in late December 2014. On the other hand, the outlook in China is sanguine although the China’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew by 7.4% during 2014, a decrease from 7.7% in 2013, and the lowest growth figure the country recorded in 24 years. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) started for some relaxation monetary policy just like inject RMB 500 billion to provide liquidity to support to the five State banks, cut the benchmark interest rates in November and December 2014, and together with the Shanghai- Hong Kong Stock Connect Programme (“SHKSCP”) started in the mid of November had indeed fueled a speculative boom in the stock markets. The Shanghai Composite Index rose over 59% from 2,033 to 3,234 in the end of March and December 2014 respectively. Heading to the first quarter of 2015, the ECB finally delivered the Euro- zone version QE in January and starting from 1st March, 2015, the ECB purchases €60 billion debt in Euro-zone’s each month until the end of September 2016. This move will help to lower the deflation risk and easing the financial pressure on the Euro-zone member countries, also boom up the Euro equity markets. On the other hand, the investors also worried about the debt default problem in Greece which brought a negative impact to the markets. Consequently, the effects of Euro- zone QE outweighed the debt default problem in Greece and triggering a strong rally in Euro equity market during this period. The DAX Index rose nearly 23% from 9,805 in end of 2014 to 12,043 at the end of first quarter 2015. On the flip side, the HSBC Flash China Purchasing Manufacturing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) dropped below 50 and Premier Li Keqiang announcing the government target for GDP growth to be down to 7% for first quarter 2015 gave a signal of growth downturn. As a result, the PBOC was moving to broader monetary policy included slashed the reserve requirement ratio for institution so that liquidity can be released. In addition, investors expected government will have more policies to stimulate the economy and led a positive effect toward the equity markets in China. The Shanghai Composite Index soaring 17.6% in the end of first quarter 2015 to 3,786 compare with the end of 2014. P.6 Turning back to the Hong Kong Stock Market, it was sensitive to new surrounding global economic situation, so the market sentiment was heavily affected by the low interest rate environment in US, the implication of Euro-zone QE, the start of SHKSCP and those monetary policies from China. Although there are some negative impacts just like “Occupy Central Movement” and GDP slow down in Hong Kong during the year, it slightly influenced the securities market. Due to the aforesaid favorable factors, more funds flowing into Hong Kong equity market and the HSI rose 12.4% from 22,151 in March 2014 to 24,901 in March 2015. Undertaking the positive impacts from last year, we expect that the world-wide economy will remain optimistic and maintain sustainable growth benefiting especially from Euro-zone QE, China’s relaxing monetary policies and SHKSCP. First and foremost, PBOC slashed the reserve requirement ratio again for all banks in China by 1% to 18.50% on 20th April, 2015 which also led to fresh liquidity available. Furthermore, the SHKSCP now has become the channel for investors accessible to China and Hong Kong equity markets. As a result, overseas funds flow into both markets and bring positive impact, which led the SHKSCP first reached the southbound daily trading quota of RMB10.5 billion on 9th April, 2015 and the trading volume of HSI reached HK$250 billion the same day. Notably, we also remain cautious on Greece’s debt default problem and possibility withdrawal from Eurozone Monetary Union which may add volatility to the financial markets. The Group remains cautiously optimistic about the outlook of the global and Hong Kong equities markets. We seek out and evaluate good investment opportunities to enrich our investment portfolios. We will also continue to adopt and maintain cautious and pragmatic investment approach in order to bring better return for our shareholders.

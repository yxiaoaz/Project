The Group’s operations are principally in the PRC and accordingly a majority part of its income and expenditure is denominated in Renminbi. The exchange rates of Renminbi against Hong Kong dollar and United States dollar have been quite stable over the past years. Also the Group’s operations will not be unduly exposed to exchange rates fluctuations as all the major assets, mainly property development projects, of the Group are located in the PRC and will generate Renminbi revenue to the Group. Except certain bank and other loans which are denominated in United States dollar or Hong Kong dollar, most of the Group’s liabilities are denominated in Renminbi. Therefore, the directors do not foresee that movement in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against Renminbi in the foreseeable future will cause a material adverse impact on the Group’s operations.

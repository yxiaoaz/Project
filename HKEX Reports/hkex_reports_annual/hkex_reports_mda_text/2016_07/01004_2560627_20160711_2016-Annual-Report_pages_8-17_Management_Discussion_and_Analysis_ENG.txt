Terrajoule’s technology incorporates energy storage with solar power generation at a storage cost lower than that for chemical battery storage, to enable a solar power station to provide electricity on demand for up to 24 hours per day, with rapid ramp, controllable power output. During the year, the Group had commenced looking into clean energy projects in various European countries. The Company had signed non-legally binding agreement with potential European partners in respect of forming joint venture for clean energy projects in Europe. However, due to the uncertainty in the prospects of the projects, the related negotiations were suspended accordingly. On 17 September 2015, the board of directors of the Company announced that the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Tianhe Smarter Energy entered into a framework agreement (the “Framework Agreement”) with Anhui Province Quanjiao County People’s Government ( ) in relation to their cooperation in the development of the 100MW fishing-solar complementary distributed photovoltaic power generation project (the “Project”) in Quanjiao, Anhui Province, the People’s Republic of China. The Group established a project company (the “Project Company”) for the development of the Project in phases, which is contemplated to involve the construction of 20MW fishing-solar complementary power plants in Phase I. Anhui Province Quanjiao County People’s Government is to assist the Project Company on, among other things, application for the relevant regulatory authorizations and licences necessary for the construction and operation of the Project. The development was still in negotiation stage. On 22 September 2015, the Company announced that further to the Company’s announcement dated 17 June 2015, the Group has made further progress in securing possible distributed solar power projects with government and non- government parties in various parts of the People’s Republic of China (the”PRC”).

It is contemplated under the Macheng Framework Agreement that Tianhe Smarter Energy and Yunzhuo New Energy will establish a project company (the “Macheng Project Company”) for the development of the Macheng Project and Yunzhuo New Energy is to assist the Macheng Project Company on, among other things, application for the relevant regulatory authorisations and licences necessary for the construction and operation of the Macheng Project. Central (Macheng) Stone will source rooftop units for the Macheng Project. In addition, the ground work of 100 MW fishing-solar complementary distributed solar power project in Quanjiao, Anhui Province, 50MW rooftop distributed solar power project in Yizheng Vehicle Industrial Park , Jiangsu Province, 50MW rooftop distributed solar power project in Central (Macheng) Stone Industrial Park , Macheng, Hubei Province had commenced. On 2 November 2015, the Company announced the lapse of the major transaction in relation to the acquisition of Incentive Power Limited, reference is made to the announcements of the Company dated 13 February 2014, 4 November 2014, 31 December 2014, 26 February 2015, 30 April 2015, 29 June 2015, 3 August 2015 and 28 August 2015 (the “Announcement(s)”) respectively, in relation to, among other things, the proposed acquisition of the entire equity interest in Incentive Power Limited, as the condition precedents to completion has not been fulfilled. No agreement was reached by the parties to extend the Long Stop Date. The vendor had refunded the deposit of HK$100,000,000 paid without interest to the Group. The Board considered that the lapse of the Acquisition Agreement would not have any material adverse impact on business, operation and financial position of the Group. During the year, revenue from trading of securities was HK$130,088,000, compared with last year HK$178,369,000, representing a decrease in sales by 27.1%. Profit of HK$126,560,000 was recorded from this sector during the year as compared to a record of HK$175,837,000 last year representing a decrease by 28.0%. The decrease in profit was mainly due to the decrease in the unrealized gain on investments in listed financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The Group’s revenue in investments was HK$1,560,000 during the year. Similar to last year, the revenue was solely generated from dividend income received from the investment in unlisted available-for-sale financial assets, an investment involved in a property project in Vietnam. Profit of HK$1,554,000 was recorded during the year as compared to the loss of HK$3,468,000 last year. The profit was mainly due to the decrease in administrative expenses of the Group in this sector. During the year, revenue of HK$6,414,000 was recorded from the sale of trading of fur garment, representing a decrease of 21.1% as compared to last year’s revenue of HK$8,125,000. A loss of HK$10,356,000 was recorded for the year, as compared to the loss of HK$7,944,000 (restated) for the last year, with an increase in loss by 30.4%. At 31 March 2016, the segment assets of this sector was HK$10,317,000 (2015:HK$12,626,000) and segment liabilities was HK$66,321,000 (2015:HK$58,440,000). Accordingly, the net liabilities of approximately HK$56,004,000 (2015:HK$45,814,000). The increase in loss was mainly due to decrease in sales and more costs occurred for marketing as a result of fierce competition in the market and the drop in consumption in luxury items. We are now reviewing the trading operations and is considering the possibility of selling or winding down this sector of business. Even though there was no revenue in the trading of fur skin during the year, being the same nil as that of last year, a loss of HK$190,000 was recorded as compared to a profit of HK$746,000 of last year. At 31 March 2016, the segment assets of this sector was HK$15,782,000 (2015: HK$15,732,000) and segment liabilities was HK$25,456,000 (2015: HK$25,235,000). Accordingly, the net liabilities of approximately HK$9,674,000 (2015: HK$9,503,000). The loss was mainly due to more administrative expenses during the year while last year the profit recorded was mainly from a compensation income originated from a skin trading customer. As market conditions for this sector has deteriorated significantly, we are now considering to winding down this sector of business. During the year, a revenue of nil was recorded for the mining business, same as that of last year. A loss of HK$223,618,000 was recorded during the year representing a decrease in loss by 55.5% as compared to last year’s loss of HK$502,342,000 (restated). The Group decided to discontinue the sector of mining business as the global metal price dropped significantly while the vanadium mining right on our book already recorded to zero during the financial year. Since we have decided to concentrate our efforts and resources towards in developing the clean energy business which brings steadier return and appear to be less risky, we had discontinued the mining operation in September 2015 and have sold the business in June 2016. The mining business is classified as discontinued operation on 30 September 2015. Certain comparative amounts have been restated and reclassified. The loss was mainly due to the impairment loss of mining right and based on its fair value at 30 September 2015 primarily due to significant drop in market price of Vanadium Pentoxide (V2O5). The valuer confirmed to the Company that since the current Vanadium price is lower than the estimated cost of production, the fair value of the exploration and evaluation assets of the vanadium mine is nominal. This has resulted in the book value of the vanadium mining right at 30 September 2015 being recorded as HK$0. An independent valuer, BMI Appraisals Limited (“BMI”), valued the mining rights at 30 September 2015 amounted to RMB0 equivalent to HK$0 as the market price of V2O5 was around RMB41,000/metric tonne as compared to its carrying amount of RMB241,000,000, equivalent to HK$300,985,000 when the market price of V2O5 was around RMB55,000/metric tonne at 31 March 2015. After 30 September 2015, the Vanadium price has continued to drop. The valuer confirmed that it adopted the same valuation methodology as the valuation at 31 March 2015 and 30 September 2015 and apart from the issue associated with Vanadium market price described above all other key parameters of valuation used are largely the same. We therefore consider that the fair value of the exploration and evaluation assets of the Vanadium mine at 31 March 2016 was still RMB0 (HK$0) as the market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2016 was almost the same as that at 30 September 2015. Such impairment losses, being accounting related adjustments to the consolidated financial statements of the Group, are non-cash in nature and do not affect the Group’s cash flow condition. The Group has subsequently disposed of the entire equity interest in Perfect Fair Limited which is an indirect-owned subsidiary of the Company in June 2016. Shaanxi Jiuquan Mining Company Limited* which operates the Vanadium mine is an indirect-owned subsidiary of Perfect Fair Limited. The reduction in valuation of the mining right this year and the last few years was mainly due to the continued steep decline of vanadium price, as follows: Market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2012 Market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2013 Market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2014 Market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2015 Market price of V2O5 at 31 March 2016 The reserves of the Vanadium Mine according to the Chinese Mineral Resource/Reserve Classification as included in the Circular of the Company dated 26 February 2008 were as follows: Contained V2O5 (tonne) (tonne) The reserves of the Vanadium Mine at 31 March 2016 remain unchanged since the acquisition in April 2008 (being 300,761 metric tonnes of V2O5), given that no material extraction was done, due to the delay in the development of the mine as a result of decline in V2O5 selling price since 2008. To pursue the clean energy policy implement in PRC and try to capture the business opportunities in this area, the Group has been and keep on putting more investments in the energy section including solar energy and renewable energy. We have successfully acquired a 100MW solar plant in Jinchan, Gansu Province and we are now in the process to develop more solar energy plants in China, at the same also try to participate in renewable energy. We believe this would assist us seeking more business partners and at the same time obtaining more new technologies. In the coming financial year, the Group will continue to focus on the developing its energy internet business and other clean-energy generation business. We are confident that the Group will achieve its goal of becoming an international innovative clean energy company in the future. In response to supportive policies introduced by decision makers of China, the Company is actively involved in clean- energy power generation businesses such as solar power, and studied and selected a number of clean energy projects for future development. In the meantime, we noted that clean-energy power generation market in China had been in the time of change. Therefore, the Company will be more active in selecting quality projects, reducing construction cost and improving return on projects. China, Europe, Japan and US, all these major developing economic entities have been continued to slow down its GDP growth in recent years despite efforts of implementing the quantitative easing policy in their region. During the first quarter of 2016 the GDP growth rate of major economies were 1.7% in Japan, 0.5% in Europe, 0.5% in USA and among the highest 6.7% in PRC. China performed among the best, but still recorded a significant drop from its double digit growth that achieved two years ago. All these poor economic performance all over the world led to drop in commodity and oil prices as a result of less demand for major resources. However under such an adverse condition, the Federal Reserve of US is still planning to increase its interest rate so as to call back its loose liquidity which resulted of quantitative easing policy first implemented by US Federal Reserve. With regard to the Group’s investments and trading in securities business, it is expected that the Hong Kong stock market will be highly volatile for the coming year. The Group will closely monitor the market condition for the coming year and adjust its portfolio of investment as appropriate and put more resources for clean energy business. The market environment for this sector in Hong Kong has been weak. Despite our efforts in establishing various marketing channels during the past few years, sales during the year has decreased while losses was increased. We foresee that operations in this segment will continue to be extremely challenging as expects to see continued delays in collection sale receivables from present customers, increase in cost of sales and drop in sales, due to fierce competition. We are considering to scale down or even probably to sell this sector of business as we expect continue loss and adverse market conditions, so as to enable us to devote our full efforts in the clean energy business. This sector of operation has been dormant for few years. As the market for this sector have deteriorated significantly, we foresee the difficulties in collecting receivables and increase in risks as we expect further drop in international skin auction price. We would not consider to re-enter this sector of business within the coming year and we may even to winding up this sector of business. For the year ended 31 March 2016, the amount of operating and administrative expenses was approximately HK$184,776,000 (2015: HK$57,830,000) (restated). The increase in operating and administrative expenses were mainly due to the increase in depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets, staff salaries and rental expenses during the year. The Group generally derives cash for operation from internal cash flow from banks in Hong Kong and PRC. At 31 March 2016, the Group had time deposit and cash and bank balances of approximately HK$294,674,000 (2015: HK$138,008,000).

The Group has also established a discretionary bonus scheme for its management and staff with awards determined annually based upon the performance of the Group and individual employees. At 31 March 2016 and 2015, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities. At 31 March 2016, the Company has issued a single guarantee of RMB598,000,000 (HK$715,626,600) to a bank in respect of the loans granted by the bank to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (note 30). The Company has not recognised any deferred income in respect of the single guarantee as its fair value cannot be reliably measured using observable market data and its transaction price was HK$Nil.

As at 31 December 2015, the Group’s total floating rate borrowings amounted to HK$7,381 million (2014: HK$3,672 million).

Remuneration and incentive packages were commensurate with the results of the Group. Performance-based incentive policy was introduced. The Group also adopted a share option scheme to reward and attract professional talents to provide long-term service to the Group. In order to advance the integrated proficiency of its employees, the Group actively encouraged its employees to attend continuing education and training programmes by providing subsidies as well as providing training according to the Company’s strategic objectives and working needs on a target-oriented basis. Looking into the future, targeting at building a strategic development system, the Group will strengthen internal control, push ahead with team building of the management and professionals, and forge a corporate culture and working environment emphasising on integrity and honesty. The Group believes these arrangements will build a solid foundation for the long term development of the Group.

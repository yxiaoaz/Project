During the year, China continued its efforts in shifting the country’s major economic drivers from export and investment oriented to domestic consumption. Despite the additional effort by the government to stimulate domestic demand and consumption, the weakening momentum of the underlying economy has dampened especially on the appetite for high-end products. Despite the challenging business environment, the Group continued to focus on consolidating its business strengths and brand equity. During the year, the Group ramped up marketing effort and promotion to strengthen customer and brand loyalty. As a result, the Group maintained a total revenue of HK$241 million (2014: HK$255 million), representing an adjustment of 5.5% from last year. Chinese baijiu segment, which accounted for 31.1% (2014: 36.7%) of the Group’s revenue, continued its product mix re-adjustment process in order to accommodate the changes of consumption pattern, resulted in a significant drop in revenue by 20.0% to HK$75 million (2014: HK$94 million). The wine segment, which currently accounted for 68.0% (2014: 63.3%) of the Group’s revenue, showed a sign of recovery. Revenue of wine increased 1.5% to HK$164 million (2014: HK$162 million). Our newly acquired casino business had also contributed HK$2 million to the Group’s revenue for the year and we shall see this trend to continue. Cost of sales decreased by 4.5% to HK$140 million (2014: 147 million). Cost of sales to total revenue increased slightly by 0.6% to 58.2% due to higher production costs from the Chinese baijiu segment. Despite the sharp fall in Chinese baijiu revenue, the cost of sales only reduced slightly by 6.0% to HK$51 million (2014: HK$54 million) reflecting a higher cost margin on the middle to low-end baijiu products being focused. Cost of sales for wine segment decreased by 4.1% to HK$89 million (2014: HK$93 million) due to improved profit margin on wine products. Evolution with Gross profit decreased by 7.0% to HK$101 million (2014: HK$108 million). Wine and Chinese baijiu segments each accounted for HK$75 million and HK$24 million respectively. Gross profit margin of wine segment increased slightly by 3.2% to 45.9% (2014: 42.7%) whereas Chinese baijiu segment fell by 10.2% to 31.7% (2014: 41.9%) leading to a drop in the Group’s gross profit margin by 0.6% to 41.8% (2014: 42.4%). Selling and distribution expenses decreased by 17.5% to HK$80 million (2014: HK$96 million) mainly due to reduced advertising and promotional expenses. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 4.8% to 33.0% (2014: 37.8%) for the year. Administrative expenses increased by 11.9% to HK$78 million (2014: HK$70 million) as a result of the consolidation of Glory Hill’s administrative expenses amounted to HK$7 million. Other operating expenses for 2014 represented impairments of goodwill and trademark of HK$171 million, and provision for slow-moving inventories of HK$8 million. There was no such impairment for the year. Taking into account of the aforementioned, loss before taxation amounted to HK$38 million (2014: loss of HK$228 million). Taxation comprises current income tax and deferred tax. Current income tax reduced by 39.2% to HK$3 million (2014: HK$5 million).

As at 31 December 2015, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of HK$306 million (2014: HK$105 million), representing an increase of 190.0%. The Group’s cash position has improved as a result of the placing of new shares during the year. As at 31 December 2015, total bank borrowing increased by 5.4% to HK$67 million (2014: HK$63 million) mainly due to the consolidation of bank borrowing of Golden Beach. Our major borrowings are denominated in Renminbi (“RMB”) and Won (“KRW”). In view of the Group’s cash and bank balances, funds generated internally from our operations and the unutilised bank facilities available, we are confident that the Group will have sufficient resources to meet its debt commitment and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future. During the year, our total capital expenditure amounted to HK$23 million (2014: HK$24 million) which was mainly used for the purchase of machineries and the construction in wineries.

Our inventories primarily consist of finished goods, work in progress and raw materials. The Group’s inventories decreased by 7.6% to HK$229 million (2014: HK$248 million). Finished goods decreased by 25.7% to HK$45 million (2014: HK$61 million) and finished goods turnover ratio (being average closing finished goods divided by cost of sales) was 137 days for the year (2014: 155 days).

As at 31 December 2015, the Group had total assets of HK$2,092 million (2014: HK$744 million) which composed of current assets of HK$940 million (2014: HK$411 million) and non-current assets of HK$1,152 million (2014: HK$333 million). Such significant increase was mainly attributable to (i) the recognition of the casino license of HK$451 million acquired through the acquisition of Golden Beach; (ii) the recognition of goodwill of HK$75 million in relation to the acquisition of Golden Beach; (iii) the consolidation of land and properties held by Glory Hill of HK$575 million; and (iv) the prepayment of HK$51 million paid by Glory Hill for the acquisition of lands in Jeju, South Korea. Total liabilities of the Group included current liabilities of HK$317 million (2014: HK$267 million) and non-current liabilities of HK$660 million (2014: HK$16 million). The significant increase of non-current liabilities was mainly because of (i) the reclassification of a bank borrowing from short-term to long-term amounted to HK$60 million; (ii) the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in relation to the casino license amounted to HK$99 million; and (iii) the consolidation of a long-term loan recorded in the books of Glory Hill from the Group’s immediate holding company amounted to HK$482 million.

About 88.9% of borrowings are from immediate holding companies which are unsecured and repayable within a 5-year period. We believe that both ratios are at healthy level indicating that the Group is able to meet its short-term and long-term debts. Trade receivables turnover (being average trade receivables divided by revenue) was 16 days (2014: 13 days). The Group did not experience any material doubtful debts that required to be written off in 2015.

The functional currency of the Group’s subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) is RMB whereas the functional currencies of the Group’s subsidiaries in South Korea are in KRW and RMB. As the impact of the fluctuation of RMB is low, therefore, no material exchange rate risk is anticipated and no financial instruments for hedging purposes are engaged. To enhance overall risk management, the Group has already strengthened its treasury management function and will closely monitor its currency and interest rate exposures. We will engage suitable foreign exchange hedging policy as and when appropriate in order to prevent the related risks.

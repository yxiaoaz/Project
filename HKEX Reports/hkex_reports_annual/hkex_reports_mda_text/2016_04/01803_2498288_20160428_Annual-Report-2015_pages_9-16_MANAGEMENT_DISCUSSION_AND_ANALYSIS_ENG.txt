As the Company obtained the written shareholders’ approval of the majority of shareholders of the Company in lieu of holding a general meeting for the approval of the Acquisition of Nobletree pursuant to Rule 14.44 of the Listing Rules, therefore no general meeting of the Company was convened to approve the Acquisition of Nobletree.

In order to strengthen the liquidity of the Group, the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into two shareholder’s loan agreements with Hollyview International Limited (the “Lender”), a substantial shareholder of the Company, on 10 November 2015 (the “Hollyview Loan Agreement”) and 24 November 2015 (the “Hollyview Facility Agreement”) (together the “Shareholder’s Loan Agreements”). Pursuant to the Hollyview Loan Agreement, the Lender agreed to lend HK$5,000,000 to the Borrower at the interest rate of 2.5% per annum which was determined after arm’s length negotiations between the parties by reference to the then prevailing bank lending interest rate. The loan under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement 1 was due on the second anniversary of the Hollyview Loan Agreement if not paid earlier. The Lender could request the Borrower to pay the loan amount and accrued interest on demand. Pursuant to the Hollyview Facility Agreement, the Lender agreed to lend to the Borrower from time to time such amount or amounts, not to exceed an aggregate outstanding principal amount of HK$30,000,000 at any time, as it may have required to meet its day-to- day operational expenses and working capital needs at the interest rate of 2.5% per annum which was determined after arm’s length negotiations between the parties by reference to the then prevailing bank lending interest rate. The loan under the Hollyview Facility Agreement was due on the second anniversary of the Hollyview Facility Agreement if not paid earlier. The Lender could request the Borrower to pay the loan amount and accrued interest on demand. Subsequently, in March 2016, the Lender agreed not to demand repayment of any amount drawn under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreements before the respective termination date of these agreements. As the Borrower was the substantial shareholder of the Company, the loans under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreements constituted connected transactions in the form of financial assistance in favour of the Group. However, as the loans under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreements were not secured by any assets of the Group, and were provided on normal commercial terms, the loans were fully-exempted from shareholders’ approval, annual review and all disclosure requirements under the Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules pursuant to Rule 14A.90. Looking ahead to 2016, the overall air cargo business environment will remain challenging. Over-capacity will continue to be a major issue. In view of the rising operating costs, the Group will implement further cost control measures such as consolidating our offices and reducing headcounts, reducing marketing, promotional and all non-revenue direct driven expenditures activities. Notwithstanding the difficult market environment in the air cargo industry on wholesaling and reselling, over-capacity in air cargo and the rising costs in labor, offices and other operating costs, the management will maintain our commitment to grow our core business and concurrently explore new revenue streams with optimized operating costs, to bloom the profitability of the Group. The Group’s revenue amounted to approximately HK$510.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2015, representing a decrease of approximately 44% when compared with last year. This was due to a decrease in air cargo handled by the Group, from 69,184 tons for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 22,739 tons for this year. Overall gross profit of the Group decreased by approximately 57.9% from approximately HK$163.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 to approximately HK$68.9 million for this year, and overall gross profit margin decreased from approximately 18.0% to approximately 13.5% respectively. The contractions were due to excess capacity available on the market. For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group’s administrative expenses amounted to approximately HK$88.9 million (2014: approximately HK$137.9 million), representing an decrease of approximately 35.5% when compared with last year, which accounted for approximately 17.4% of the Group’s turnover (2014: approximately 15.2%). The decrease in administrative expenses was mainly due to the decrease in number of employees and offices. The Group had an un-utilised bank facility of approximately HK$79.5 million as at 31 December 2015 and the facility was mainly secured by the pledged deposits of approximately HK$6.4 million of our Group and keyman insurance policies. In March 2016, the total banking facilities decreased from HK$136.6 million to HK$63.4 million due to the renewed banking facilities granted to the Group. Certain airlines and integrated carriers would require their air cargo wholesalers to deliver bank guarantees before their appointment. The aggregate guarantee amount provided was approximately HK$31.7 million as at 31 December 2015 (2014: approximately HK$80.1 million). Saved as disclosed above, we had no material contingent liabilities and guarantees. As at 31 December 2015, the Group had operating lease commitments of approximately HK$8.2 million (2014: approximately HK$13.7 million). The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Renminbi and United States dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. During the year 2015, the Group had not hedged its foreign exchange risk because the exposure, after netting off the assets and liabilities subject to foreign exchange risk, is not very significant. However, our management monitors foreign exchange exposure and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arises. As at 31 December 2015, the Group had 105 full-time employees (2014: 258). The Group reviews remuneration and benefits of its employees annually according to the relevant market practice and individual performance of the employees. Save for the social insurance in China and the mandatory provident fund scheme in Hong Kong, the Group has not set aside or accrued any significant amount of money to provide for retirement or similar benefits for its employees. The staff costs incurred for the year ended 31 December 2015 were approximately HK$48.5 million (2014: approximately HK$84.9 million).

As a leading manufacturer of rotary kilns, grinding equipment and their related equipment in the PRC and the global market, business activities of the Group are divided into three business lines, namely (i) manufacturing of equipment, in which we engage in the design, manufacturing and sales of equipment including related parts and components for various industries including building materials, metallurgy, chemical and environmental protection industries; (ii) installation services, in which we mainly provide installation services to our customers under our manufacturing of equipment business as this is part and parcel of our manufacturing of equipment business; and (iii) construction of production line, in which we act as an EPC service provider providing bespoke one-stop solutions in respect of design, procurement, construction and/or trial operations of production lines. The Company’s shares were successfully listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange on 15 November 2019 raising total net proceeds of approximately HK$150.0 million from the share offer (the “Share Offer”) as described in the prospectus of the Company dated 31 October 2019 (the “Prospectus“), after deduction of underwriting fees and commissions and expenses of the Company in connection with the Share Offer. The successful Listing enabled the Company to enter into the international capital market to ensure sufficient capital for future development. We believe that diversifying our business and relying on a wide spread of customers for revenue generation will be critical for our future sustainability and growth. The Group continued to expand its customer base by reinforcing the Group’s market presence in the building materials industry. During the year ended 31 December 2019, revenue generated from customers in the building materials industry amounted to approximately RMB791.0 million (2018: RMB510.2 million). Apart from serving our customers in the building materials industry, the Group has also expanded its products and services to serve our customers in other industries, mainly metallurgy, chemical and environmental protection industries as a result of our research and development efforts. Revenue generated from our customers of equipment manufacturing in non-building materials industries accounted for approximately 62.4% and 68.2%, respectively, of our total revenue in the manufacturing of equipment business for the year 2018 and 2019. In order to tap into the metallurgy, chemical and environmental protection industries with a primary focus on the treatment of various municipal solid waste, during the year of 2019, approximately HK$13.0 million of the net proceeds from the Share Offer were used in the purchase of new machinery and the construction of a new production plant for manufacturing rotary kilns that possess the latest roasting and pyrolysis technology. The Group also continued its effort to expand its business into potential markets along the “Belt and Road” countries including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) and Turkey. Revenue generated from our customers in the “Belt and Road” countries accounted for approximately 26.2% and 31.4%, respectively, of our total revenue for the years 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, most of our customers under our construction of production line business are located in “Belt and Road” countries. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group has participated in the construction of five production line projects, four of which were located in “ Belt and Road” countries which were on- going production line projects as at 31 December 2019, one of which, being the construction of an active lime production line project in Anhui Province, the PRC was completed. To maintain the Group’s market position in the rotary kiln and grinding equipment industries and expand the Group’s product portfolio and improve the functionality and efficiency of its products, the Group has invested in its research and development capabilities focusing on the energy saving and environmentally-friendliness technologies and continued to cooperate with research institutions in the PRC. In collaboration with the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( ), “Research and development of efficient rotary kiln technology for the treatment of co-processing solid waste” ( ) is being carried out. During the year, the Group has also participated in the discussion on the setting of national standard for “Technical Requirements for Complete Set of Lime Calcination Equipment” ( ). As at 31 December 2019, the Group had 55 authorised patents, of which 31 were invention patents, and 42 patent applications pending approval which primarily relate to manufacture of products in our rotary kiln and grinding equipment system. We believe the PRC government will continue adopting policies to stimulate the economy as well as encouraging investment in overseas infrastructure along the “Belt and Road” countries. Looking ahead, in light of the growing demand of rotary kilns, grinding equipment and their related equipment in the overseas market, the Group will continue to make good use of the “Belt and Road” initiatives and actively explore opportunities in relation to construction of production lines located in “Belt and Road” countries and emerging markets where there is a significant demand for building materials as well as production equipment relating to building materials. Going forward, in view of higher level of awareness of environmental protection and the PRC government’s strong desire to eliminate backward production capacity and excessive capacities in the building materials industry and reducing pollution from cement industry, the Group will continue to expand the Group’s products and services to customers in other industries such as metallurgy, chemical and environmental protection industries. Despite the uncertainties caused by the Epidemic outbreak in the first quarter of 2020, the Group remains cautiously optimistic in the rotary kiln, grinding equipment and their related equipment market as we believe the impact of the Epidemic outbreak on China’s economy and the Group’s operation will be temporary. The Group will use its best endeavours to minimise any potential impact on the operation and financial performance of the Group from the Epidemic and stick to its business strategies. Year- over-Year Our revenue increased by approximately RMB449.3 million or 44.2% from approximately RMB1,016.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately RMB1,465.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 as a result of growth of our revenue generated from the construction of production line business and manufacturing of equipment business during the year ended 31 December 2019. Manufacturing of equipment. Revenue derived from manufacturing of equipment business increased by RMB181.2 million or 23.2% from RMB780.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 to RMB961.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The increase in revenue derived from manufacturing of equipment business was primarily due to sales of our products in the rotary kiln system made to a few major customers in mainland China with considerably large revenue contribution during the year ended 31 December 2019 as compared with customers in the same period of 2018. Installation services. Revenue derived from our installation services business decreased by approximately RMB0.6 million or 2.6% to approximately RMB21.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB22.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This decrease was mainly due to the decreased demand of installation services from customers under our manufacturing of equipment business for the year ended 31 December 2019. Construction of production line. Revenue from our construction of production line business increased by approximately RMB268.6 million or 125.6% to approximately RMB482.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB213.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to our production line projects located in Kazakhstan and Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) which contributed in aggregate a revenue of approximately RMB415.4 million during the year ended 31 December 2019. Our cost of sales and services increased by approximately RMB349.8 million or 43.7% to approximately RMB1,149.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB799.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly due to the increase of our total revenue. Cost of raw materials, being the largest component of our cost of sales and services, increased due to the carrying out of the construction of production lines and enhanced sales of the manufacturing of equipment business which resulted in an increase of approximately RMB290.0 million in cost of sales and services during the year ended 31 December 2019. As a result of the foregoing, the Group’s gross profit increased by approximately RMB99.4 million or 46.0% to approximately RMB315.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB216.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Group’s gross profit margin remained relatively stable at 21.5% for the year ended 31 December 2019 as compared to 21.3% for the year ended 31 December 2018. Our other income decreased by approximately RMB24.3 million or 89.0% to approximately RMB3.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB27.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly due to decrease in government subsidies of approximately RMB22.7 million received during the year ended 31 December 2019 as compared with the year ended 31 December 2018. We recorded other gains of approximately RMB6.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2019, representing a decrease of 23.1% as compared with approximately RMB8.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. This was mainly due to the change from a net foreign exchange gain of approximately RMB4.7 million recorded in the year of 2018 to a net foreign exchange loss of approximately RMB0.7 million recorded during the year ended 31 December 2019, which was partially offset by the increase in the investment gain on financial assets at FVTPL of approximately RMB3.1 million. Our distribution and selling expenses increased by approximately RMB34.2 million or 45.7% to approximately RMB108.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB74.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly due to increased transportation and port expenses incurred by our Group in relation to the product delivery of oversea production lines and sales of equipment to one of our major customers in mainland China during the year ended 31 December 2019. Our administrative expenses increased by approximately RMB5.6 million or 13.5% to approximately RMB47.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB41.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly attributable to the increase in annual bonus and professional fees incurred in relation to the Listing in 2019. Our research expenditure increased by approximately RMB14.2 million or 43.9% to approximately RMB46.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB32.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly due to the increased technical consultancy fee incurred for technical support consultation for the manufacturing of equipment and construction of production line projects during the year ended 31 December 2019. Impairment losses on trade and other receivables and contract assets increased by approximately RMB6.5 million or 257.6% to approximately RMB9.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB2.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 mainly due to an increase in impairment loss on trade receivables recognised for the year ended 31 December 2019 and as a result of the increased balance of trade receivables as at 31 December 2019. Our income tax expenses increased by approximately RMB2.8 million or 19.1% to approximately RMB17.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB14.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. Our effective tax rate was 16.5% and 17.8% for the year ended 31 December 2018 and 2019, respectively. The comparatively higher effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2019 was mainly due to the tax effect of non-deductible expenses incurred by the Group in relation to the Listing during the year. As a result of the foregoing, the profit and total comprehensive income for the year attributable to owners of the Company increased by approximately RMB6.4 million or 8.9% to approximately RMB78.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB72.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Group maintained sufficient working capital as at 31 December 2019 and continued to adopt a prudent treasury policy in managing its cash balances and maintain a strong and healthy liquidity to ensure that the Group is well placed to take advantage of growth opportunities of its business. Net current assets of the Group amounted to approximately RMB294.1 million (31 December 2018: RMB37.2 million) with a current ratio calculated by dividing our current assets over our current liabilities of 115.6% (31 December 2018: 102.7%) as at 31 December 2019. Inventories increased by approximately RMB270.9 million or 64.6% to approximately RMB690.0 million as at 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB419.1 million as at 31 December 2018. Inventory turnover days was 176 days for the year ended 31 December 2019, representing an increase of 24 days as compared to 152 days for the year ended 31 December 2018. The increase in inventories was mainly due to the increased balance of work-in-progress maintained as at 31 December 2019. The increase in inventory turnover days was mainly because of the increase in work-in-progress arising from our ongoing contract liabilities. Trade, bills and other receivables increased by approximately RMB167.7 million or 29.0% to approximately RMB746.1 million as at 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB578.4 million as at 31 December 2018, among which trade receivables increased by approximately RMB201.3 million or 107.1% to approximately RMB389.2 million as compared with approximately RMB187.9 million as at 31 December 2018. Such change was mainly due to the delay in settlement from one of our production line customers resulting from the prolonged approval procedures of its financing bank. In May 2019, our Group, due to the expected delay in settlement from this customer, entered into a supplemental agreement with such customer pursuant to which our Group agreed to defer an amount of RMB280 million (the “Deferred Payment”), being the outstanding payment upon completion of the construction of such production line, carried out a fixed interest rate of 8.41% per annum. The Deferred Payment to the extent of RMB280 million would be settled in every three months by 12 installments starting from 30 June 2020. Any receivable balance, apart from the Deferred Payment, from this customer should be settled as originally scheduled. Our trade receivables turnover days was 68 days (2018: 58 days) for the year ended 31 December 2019 representing an increase of 10 days. The increase in trade receivable turnover days during the year was primarily due to the increased balance of trade receivables as at 31 December 2019 for the reason mentioned above. Prepayments to suppliers increased by approximately RMB63.2 million or 68.4% to approximately RMB155.5 million as at 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB92.4 million as at 31 December 2018 primarily due to the increased prepayments made to the suppliers for the purchase of raw materials. Contract liabilities increased by approximately RMB548.6 million or 79.2% to approximately RMB1,241.0 million as at 31 December 2019 from approximately RMB692.4 million as at 31 December 2018. The significant increase in contract liabilities was mainly due to the advance payments received from our customers during the year for new contracts obtained. The Group funds its business operations both through cash flows generated from its business operations and through external financing, primarily including banking facilities. The Group’s primary uses of cash are for the payment for: (a) raw materials; (b) sub-contracting fees; (c) staff costs; and (d) overhead. As at 31 December 2019, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately RMB486.4 million (31 December 2018: approximately RMB233.9 million). A portion of the Group’s bank deposits totalling approximately RMB12.2 million (31 December 2018: approximately RMB13.6 million) were restricted for the issue of bills payables and letter of credit by the Group. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits were mostly denominated in Renminbi, United States dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euro. As at 31 December 2019, we had banking facilities of approximately RMB560.0 million, of which approximately RMB185.5 million were utilised. The utilised banking facilities as at 31 December 2019 represented bank guarantee of approximately RMB161.5 million and bank acceptance bill amounted to approximately RMB24.0 million. As at 31 December 2019, our Group had unutilised banking facilities amounted to approximately RMB374.5 million. As at 31 December 2019, the Group did not have any bank borrowings (31 December 2018: Nil). As at 31 December 2019, the Company’s gearing ratio, which is calculated by dividing our total liabilities over our equity attributable to owners of the Company multiplied by 100%, was 350.9% (31 December 2018: 469.3%). The decrease in our gearing ratio was mainly due to the increased balance of our equity as at 31 December 2019 arising from the net proceeds from the Share Offer. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group recorded approximately RMB119.8 million (2018: net cash used in operating activities RMB7.9 million) net cash from operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2019 amounted to approximately RMB4.1 million (2018: net cash from investing activities RMB320.0 million). Net cash from financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2019 amounted to approximately RMB136.2 million (2018: net cash used in financing activities RMB176.0 million). The Board and the management of the Company had been closely monitoring the Group’s liquidity position, performing ongoing credit evaluations, and monitoring the financial conditions of its customers, in order to ensure the Group’s healthy cash position. The Group is exposed to market risks from changes in market rates and prices, such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit and liquidity. The Group’s exposure to currency risk relates primarily to the Group’s sales to customers outside mainland China which is usually denominated in USD. During the year ended 31 December 2019, approximately 15% (2018: 15%) of the Group’s sales is denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entities making the sale. The Group has not adopted any foreign exchange hedging policy, engaged in any currency hedging or had any positions in any derivative financial instruments to hedge our currency risk as management of the Group considers that the foreign exchange risk exposure of the Group is minimal. The Group will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise. The Group’s exposure to risk for changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s loans to and amounts due to independent third parties and the floating-rate restricted bank balance and bank balances. The Group currently does not have any interest rate hedging policy. The Group monitors its exposures on an on-going basis and will consider hedging interest rate risk should the need arise. Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade, bills and other receivables, contract assets, restricted bank deposits and bank balances. Given that 75% (31 December 2018: 28%) and 75% (31 December 2018: 42%) of the total trade receivables was due from the Group’s largest customer and the five largest customers as at 31 December 2019, the Group has concentration of credit risk. In order to minimise the credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of each individual receivables at the end of each reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group did not experience any liquidity shortage. We managed our liquidity risks by maintaining adequate level of cash and cash equivalents to finance the Group’s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. As at 31 December 2019, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities (31 December 2018: Nil). As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s capital expenditure amounted to approximately RMB25.0 million (31 December 2018: approximately RMB19.9 million) which was mainly related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, purchase of intangible assets and payments for right-of-use assets. As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s restricted bank deposits and bills receivable with an aggregate carrying amount of approximately RMB14.0 million were pledged to banks for issuing bills payables. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s restricted bank deposits, right-of- use assets, buildings and bills receivable with an aggregate carrying amount of approximately RMB93.7 million were pledged to banks for obtaining line of credit, securing the Group’s banking facilities or issuing bills payables. As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s capital expenditure in respect of acquisition of property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to approximately RMB19.0 million (31 December 2018: approximately RMB0.4 million). Save for the capital commitments and pledged assets disclosed above, the Group did not enter into any material off-balance sheet transactions or arrangements during the year ended 31 December 2019 and up to the date of this annual report. As at 31 December 2019, the Group had a total of 949 employees (31 December 2018: 872) including staff from administrative, finance, sales, supply, technical, quality control, and production departments. Remuneration packages of our employees usually comprise, among other things, salaries, bonus, contribution to pension schemes and allowances. We regularly review and determine the remuneration and compensation package of our employees by reference to, among other things, their performance, qualifications, respective responsibilities and market levels of salaries paid by comparable companies. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group incurred staff cost (including Directors’ remuneration) of approximately RMB105.1 million (2018: approximately RMB94.9 million). The Group provides to our employees on a regular basis and when deemed necessary training covering various aspects of our business operation, including work safety, sales and marketing, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, technical skills, management and production quality. The Group did not experience any major labour disputes, work stoppages or labour strikes that led to disruptions in our Group’s operations. The Directors consider that the Group has maintained a good working relationship with its staff. Net proceeds from the Share Offer and the Listing of the Company on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange on 15 November 2019 (the “Listing Date”), after deduction of the underwriting fees and commissions and expenses of the Company in connection with the Share Offer was approximately HK$150.0 million. The Group would apply such proceeds in a manner consistent with the intended use of proceeds as disclosed in the Prospectus. The table below sets forth the utilisation of the net proceeds from the Share Offer and the unused amount as at 31 December 2019.

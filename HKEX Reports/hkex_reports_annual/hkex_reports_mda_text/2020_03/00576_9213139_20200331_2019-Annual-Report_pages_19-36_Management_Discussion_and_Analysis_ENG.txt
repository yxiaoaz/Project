Management Discussion Global economic growth slowed down in 2019, as international financial markets were volatile and international trade slowed. Domestic economic activity remained stable, posting a 6.1% increase in GDP during the Period. Zhejiang Province’s GDP grew by 6.8% year-on-year, which was 0.7 percentage points higher than the national rate, as it benefited from a moderate increase in the province’s international trade, consumer demand and fixed assets investment. During the Period, the growth rate of traffic volume and toll revenue of the Group slowed down due to the adverse impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war. Revenue from Zheshang Securities recorded significant growth as supported by the pick-up of Chinese capital markets, which resulted a year-on-year increase of 6.8% in the Group’s total revenue. Total revenue of the Group was Rmb11,955.27 million, of which Rmb8,061.01 million was generated by the seven major expressways operated by the Group (2018 (Restated): total revenue of Rmb7,854.48 million), representing 67.4% of the total revenue. The revenue generated by the securities business was Rmb3,300.78 million (2018: total revenue of Rmb2,921.27 million), representing 27.6% of the total revenue. A breakdown of the Group’s revenue for the Period is set out below: Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Management Discussion Executive Director and During the Period, traffic volume and toll revenue on the Group’s expressways recorded mixed performance with varied growth rates. During the Period, the Yuhang District Government and the Lin’an District Government of Hangzhou City, the Yiwu Municipal Government and the Huzhou Municipal Government offered to pay the toll for all passenger vehicles that have ETC registration and are travelling on the expressways within their jurisdictions, which benefited the traffic volume growth on the Yuhang Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway, the Lin’an Section of the Hanghui Expressway, the Jinhua Section of the Ningbo-Jinhua Expressway and the Huzhou Section of the Shenjiahuhang Expressway, respectively. However, during the Period, the toll discount policies for vehicles that have ETC registration had negative impact on toll revenue of the Group’s expressways in varied degrees. From January 1, 2019, all trucks that have ETC registration enjoyed a 15% discount on tolls. From July 1, 2019, all vehicles that have ETC registration enjoyed a 5% discount on tolls when travelling on the expressways of Zhejiang Province. In addition, certain sections of expressways operated by the Group encountered traffic diversions caused by neighboring roadways. The traffic volume on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway was negatively impacted by the opening of the Yuhang section of the Hangzhou Urban Elevated Highway and the completion of construction of the National Highway G320. The Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou Expressway, which is connected to the Shangsan Expressway, had construction works that closed off traffic, and the Zhangzhen toll station on National Highway G104 parallel to the Shangsan Expressway ceased toll collection on June 1, 2018. Both factors have negatively affected traffic volume on the Shangsan Expressway. The opening of North Qiushi Road in December 2018, which is parallel to the Lianshi-Hangzhou Section of the Shenjiahuhang Expressway, caused significant traffic volume diversion and a decrease in toll revenue for the section. The opening of Zhoushan Fuchimen Bridge on September 29, 2019 also caused certain traffic volume diversion to the Zhoushan Bay Bridge. During the Period, total toll revenue from the 248km Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway, the 141km Shangsan Expressway, the 70km Jinhua Section of the Ningbo-Jinhua Expressway, the 122km Hanghui Expressway, the 82km Huihang Expressway, the 93km Shenjiahuhang Expressway and the 46km Zhoushan Bay Bridge was Rmb8,061.01 million.

In 2021 (the “Period under Review”), despite the novel coronavirus (the “epidemic”) outbreak had triggered global economic recession, however, with improved epidemic prevention and control, together with the policies stimulating the consumption, various business activities were gradually lifted from lockdowns, and markets and industries progressively resumed business operation and production. The global economy began to show signs of recovery from the impacts of the epidemic. In 2021, China continued to maintain a global leading position in terms of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development through its scientific coordination of epidemic prevention and had successfully achieved its principal targets and tasks set at the beginning of the year. The contribution rate of final consumption and net exports to economic growth throughout the year was significantly higher than the pre-epidemic period. The industrial economy maintained a steady bounce-back momentum, while the recovery of service industry was subject to the greater impact and fluctuation with differentiated structure. The impact of the epidemic on China’s economy was temporary and ought not change the fundamentals of China’s long-term and sound economic expansion. In 2021, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) was RMB114,366.97 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.1%, with an average growth rate of 5.1% for the two years. From the quarterly perspective, the first quarter went up by 18.3% year-on- year while second quarter increased by 7.9% year-on-year, third quarter rose by 4.9% year-on-year, and fourth quarter grew by 4% year-on-year. 2021 is a critical year for recovery after the epidemic, and the advertising market experienced a sound recovery growth with occasional epidemic disturbance. According to the continuous advertising monitoring database of CTR, the overall domestic advertising market in 2021 increased by 11.2% year-on-year, and various channels showed a recovery trend with modest improvement except for traditional outdoor advertising. Expenses on television, radio, elevator LCD and elevator poster advertisements continued to rise, representing a year-on-year increase of 1.3%, 3.4%, 31.5% and 32.4%, respectively. The video advertising expenses in cinema experienced a recovery growth to 253.2%, and the expenses on traditional outdoor advertising, newspapers, magazine went down further by 13.6%, 22% and 7.8% year-on-year respectively. From the industry perspective, advertising expenditures in industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, bathroom products and personal supplies recorded a remarkable increase year-on-year. In 2021, the film market in Mainland China continued to lead the world. As the first year after the epidemic had become stabilised, total box office of Chinese films in 2021 reached RMB47.258 billion, recovering to 74% of the pre-epidemic level. In terms of content supply, a total of 697 films were shown for the year, reaching historic high. The lower tier market continued to expand, and for the first time, representing a share of approaching 40% in third– and fourth-tier cities. Of which, the fourth-tier cities, in particular, recovered relatively quicker after the epidemic, with yearly movie-goers exceeded the first– and third-tier cities. For the twelve months ended 31 December 2021, the Group recorded a revenue of RMB265.2 million in its principal business (2020: RMB126.4 million). Gross profit was RMB21.7 million (2020: RMB13.9 million), and gross profit margin decreased from 17.2% in 2020 to 8.2% in 2021. Loss for the year increased to approximately RMB188.9 million (2020: RMB74.5 million). During the period, the business environment remained challenging in the print media market as the market continued to be hit by new online media. Together with the intense competition from new media and the Internet, the speed of transformation of the advertising industry has intensified, the daily circulation and the number of printed pages of Southeast Express operated by the Group remained unsatisfactory. The public vehicles advertising mainly generates revenue from TV advertisements on public vehicles. For the twelve months ended 31 December 2021, newspapers and public vehicles advertising contributed RMB13.3 million to the Group’s revenue (2020: RMB10.2 million), with a gross profit margin of 30.3% (2020: 45.4%). For the twelve months ended 31 December 2021, the Group’s revenue from marketing and consulting services was approximately RMB75.2 million, representing an increase of 36.6% as compared with 2020, while gross profit margin was 3.6%.

The sales of agricultural products of the Group mainly focus on ornamental plants, which tend to record higher sales in the second half year, and the sales of which are generally peaked towards the end of the calendar year. During the Period under Review, the Group was still conducting market survey to decide the business models of www.dnkb.com.cn and www.duk.cn and as such, the Internet services segment has yet to contribute any revenue to the Group. Total revenue increased by 109.8% from RMB126.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB265.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, primarily due to the increased revenue from the sales of agricultural products. Revenue from marketing and consulting services increased from RMB55.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB75.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. Revenue from newspaper and public vehicle advertising increased from RMB10.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB13.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2021.

Gross profit margin decreased from 17.2% in 2020 to 8.2% in 2021, which was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of agricultural products which generally had lower gross profit margin. Other income decreased from RMB2.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB1.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, mainly due to the decrease in government grant of RMB2.2 million in the year. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 234.3% from RMB7.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB26.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, mainly due to the increased selling and marketing expenses of the sales of agricultural products. General and administrative expenses decreased by 28.0% from RMB56.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB40.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, mainly due to (i) decrease in amortisation of intangible assets of RMB2.3 million; (ii) decrease in foreign exchange losses from RMB3.7 million to RMB2.0 million; and (iii) decrease in net loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of RMB6.4 million. As a result of (i) the provision for impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right- of-use assets; and (ii) the decrease in net change in provision for impairment of financial and contract assets, loss before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2021 was RMB233.2 million, representing an increase of 150.3% as compared to loss before income tax of RMB93.2 million for the year ended 31 December The Group recorded a net loss for the year of RMB188.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, representing an increase of 153.4% as compared to loss for the year of RMB74.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2020. Increase in loss for the year was mainly attributable to the increase in one-off provision for impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets for the year ended 31 December 2021. As a result of the above factors, loss attributable to non-controlling interests increased from RMB0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB1.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. As a result of the above factors, loss attributable to owners of the Company increased from RMB73.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 to RMB187.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. As at 31 December 2021, the Group had total assets of approximately RMB240.0 million (2020: RMB433.2 million) and total borrowings and lease liabilities totalling approximately RMB195.9 million (2020: RMB193.6 million), representing a gearing ratio, defined as total borrowings over total assets, of approximately 81.6% (2020: 44.7%). The Group had net current liabilities of approximately RMB213.2 million (2020: RMB32.8 million), calculated from the current assets of approximately RMB139.2 million (2020: RMB67.9 million) and current liabilities of approximately RMB352.5 million (2020: RMB100.7 million), representing a current ratio of approximately 0.4 (2020: 0.7). As at 31 December 2021, the Group had cash and bank balances of approximately RMB9.8 million (2020: RMB14.3 million), including restricted cash of RMB0.9 million. During year ended 31 December 2021, the Group reported a net loss of RMB188,864,000 and had a net cash outflow from operating activities of RMB5,427,000. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by RMB213,244,000 and the Group had a deficit in equity attributable to owners of the Company of RMB125,626,000. As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s current borrowings a m o u n t e d t o R M B 1 8 7 , 7 0 6 , 0 0 0 i n t o t a l , i n c l u d i n g RMB181,356,000 convertible bonds owned by the major shareholder in Hong Kong and bank borrowings of RMB6,350,000, while it had cash and cash equivalents of approximately RMB8,851,000 only. Subsequent to 31 December 2021, the Group failed to repay a bank borrowing of RMB5,900,000 in full in accordance with the scheduled repayment dates of the underlying bank borrowings agreement, and a principal of RMB3,900,000 and interest of RMB6,000 became overdue (the “Overdue Bank Borrowing”). The Overdue Bank Borrowings are secured by the Group’s property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of RMB6,928,000 as at 31 December 2021. The Group is in active negotiation with the bank in respect of the Overdue Bank Borrowings for renewal, extension and replacement of the relevant bank borrowings and the directors are confident that agreements will be reached in due course. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) outbreak that led to a series of severe administrative control and precautionary measures taken by governments and authorities in Mainland China temporarily disrupted the operations of the Group’s various business and in particular the progress of the Group’s tourism and integrated development has been delayed. Management expects that the China’s government would launch additional proactive economic and monetary policies to stimulate its economic cycle and is confident that the Group’s operation will be recovered in The above conditions indicate the existence of material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. In order to improve the Group’s financial position, the directors of the Company have been implementing various measures as set out in Note 2.1 to the consolidated financial statements, including disposal of properties, the commencement of commercial operations of projects to generate income and operating cashflows, obtaining written confirmations from the directors and related parties, negotiating with the bank for renewal of bank facilities, raising funds through placement of the Company’s shares, cost-control measures, expedition in debt collection, generating sufficient inflow from the sales of properties held for sale and deference of discretionary capital expenditure. The directors, after making due enquiries and considering the basis of management’s projections described above and after taking into account the reasonably possible changes in the operation performance, believe there will be sufficient financial resources available to the Group at least in the coming twelve months to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Accordingly, the directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. Should the Group be unable to continue to operate as a going concern, adjustments would have to be made to write down the carrying value of the Group’s assets to their recoverable amounts, to provide for any further liabilities which might arise and to reclassify non-current assets and non-current liabilities as current assets and current liabilities, respectively. The effect of these adjustments have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. For the year ended 31 December 2021, net cash used in operating activities amounted to RMB5.4 million, primarily attributable to the loss before income tax for the year amounted to RMB233.2 million and partially offset by non-cash items, which primarily included (i) provision for impairment of intangible assets amounted to RMB161.3 million, (ii) provision impairment of property, plant and equipment of RMB8.8 million, (iii) finance costs of RMB20.0 million; and (iv) depreciation and amortisation of RMB8.4 million.

For the year ended 31 December 2021, net cash used in financing activities amounted to RMB11.7 million, mainly attributable to the repayment of bank borrowings of RMB12.0 million. Capital expenditures incurred during the year are mainly for the purchase or construction costs related to properties, plant and equipment. Capital expenditures were RMB1.0 million and RMB1.6 million for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2021, respectively. The aging analysis of the Group’s trade receivables based on invoice dates is set out in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statement. Trade receivables increased by 28.3% from RMB5.5 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB7.0 million as at 31 December 2021. Such increase was mainly attributable to more revenue generated during the year in general and particularly near year end. The non-current prepayments, deposits and other receivables decreased by 74.2% from RMB80.5 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB20.8 million as at 31 December 2021 while the current prepayments, deposits and other receivables increased by 440% from RMB11.5 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB62.1 million as at 31 December 2021, mainly due to the reclassification of deposits for marketing and promotion contracts of RMB52.0 million from non-current assets to current assets. As at 31 December 2021, properties held for sale amounted to approximately RMB22.8 million (2020: RMB24.3 million). The properties in the PRC were received in exchange of advertising services to real estate developers in the PRC. The Group’s intention is to sell these properties and, accordingly, such rights are recognised as properties held for sale upon the completion of the advertising sales transaction if the related properties are ready to be sold. Management assessed the fair value less costs to sell of the properties with reference to their market value with the assistance of an independent property valuer. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the management compared the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell of the properties and considered no further impairment provision is necessary based on the valuation of the valuer (2020: Nil). The aging analysis of the Group’s trade payables based on invoice dates is set out in Note 21. Trade payables increased from approximately RMB11.8 million as at 31 December 2020 to RMB12.8 million as at 31 December 2021.

A contingent liability will be disclosed when a possible obligation has arisen, but its existence has to be confirmed by future events outside the Group’s control, or when it is not possible to calculate the amount.

The Company operates an employee share option scheme, the purpose of which is to incentivise or reward eligible individuals who provide services to the Company for their contributions and their continuing efforts to promote the interests of the Company, and for other purposes as the Board may approve from time to time. The employee share option scheme lapsed in November Since 2021, under the normalised epidemic prevention and control situation, the domestic economy has, in general, demonstrated a positive recovery trend. The domestic economy will continue to recuperate steadily with an unimpeded cycle of supply and demand, adjusted and optimised economic structure, continuously strengthened the momentum for innovation and fully explored the potential of the domestic market. With the remarkable achievements of epidemic prevention and control and the recovery of household income, the China economy as a whole maintained a recovery trend, and consumption continued to improve. This year is the beginning of the “14th Five-Year Plan”. The government has clearly put forward the goals of expanding domestic demand and optimising consumption market. The contribution of consumption to China’s economic growth will be significantly improved, the consumption structure of residents will continue to upgrade, the integration of online and offline consumption will accelerate, and the innovation in new business forms and new models will develop in a healthier and more sustainable way. On the other hand, the development of domestic cultural industry continues to receive national focus. With the introduction of a number of policies that are conducive to the development of the cultural media industry, the film and television industry will enter a golden stage that benefits all parties and promote China from a big movie country to a powerful regime. The tremendous consumption potential and the rapid development of digital innovation technology are expected to push China’s film and television industry to new heights. Going forward, these positive factors are expected to drive the Group to continue to develop its existing businesses of advertising, marketing and consulting, and agricultural products. At the same time, the Group will continue to focus on restructuring its publishing and advertising businesses by consolidating with cultural and film media businesses in PRC, so as to broaden the long-term income sources of the Group. The Group will more actively leverage its experience and resources in the advertising, film, culture and media industries to develop integrated projects on the theme of film or media, and develop these projects focusing on industry positioning, cultural heritage, tourism features, eco-agriculture, entertainment and community functions such as health and wellness, so as to form synergies with the existing businesses. In addition, the Group will continue to strive to identify suitable industry partners and investment or cooperation projects to capture business opportunities which form synergy with our existing businesses, as well as the transformation and upgrade that combine the strength of online and offline activities in the new media era. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) outbreak that led to a series of severe administrative control and precautionary measures taken by governments and authorities in Mainland China temporarily disrupted the operations of the Group’s various business and in particular the progress of the Group’s tourism and integrated development has been delayed. Management expects that the China’s government would launch additional proactive economic and monetary policies to stimulate its economic cycle and is confident that the Group’s operation will recover in 2022.

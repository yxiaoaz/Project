Zhang Jianwei The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) detailed in other sections of the annual report of the Company. The Group is a leading logistics service provider in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) whose principal activities include freight forwarding, express services and shipping agency, complemented by ancillary operations in storage and terminal services, marine transportation and other services such as trucking and air cargo transportation. The geographical areas covered by the Group’s businesses operation include Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Lianyungang, Shandong, Tianjin and Liaoning, etc., being coastal regions under rapid growth and other strategic locations in the mainland. We also have an extensive domestic service network, as well as a large overseas agency network. Through acquisitions of business networks and assets from the parent company, the geographical coverage of our business has been extended to Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Chongqing and Hong Kong. With comprehensive service networks and the means and capabilities to provide integrated services, the Group has become a leading provider of integrated logistics services in the market. In 2008, the Group addressed challenges from the complex and fast-changing market in a proactive manner and persisted in full-scale development. With ongoing improvements in the quality of our operations, in-depth structural realignments and optimised business models, we have been able to deliver satisfactory results. Strategic planning and in-depth resource integration initiatives were implemented. Organisational and structural optimisation was pursued and complementary additions were made to our business presence. The progress of structural realignment was enhanced. Shipping routes were integrated to drive intensified operation of our shipping route business, while the geographic distribution and transportation capacities of our inland shipping routes were re-aligned to drive integrated operation of the Yangtze River routes. New major customers were added to our clientele. Substantial progress was made in large-scale projects, such as chemical logistics, contractual logistics and engineering logistics. Optimisation and integration of traditional businesses was advanced to bolster development of new markets, while we continued the build-up of the cargo-space booking platform; active re-alignment of shipping route distribution was made to substantiate and complement our short-distance shipping routes, while steady progress was noted in our inland trade transportation business. The distribution of our overseas networks was further complemented with improved marketing capabilities for the networks. Strategic investments were advanced with enhanced management of significant investment projects and infrastructure projects. Fundamental management was strengthened. Comprehensive risk management was implemented with measures to enhance receivables and cash flow management; management of details was promoted to exercise further control over cost growth while investment management was further improved.

For the year ended 31 December 2008, eastern China in the segments accounted for 68.1% of total turnover before inter-segment elimination, as eastern China was economically the most developed region in the PRC. The table below sets forth the operating profit/(loss) (in millions of RMB) of results of segment generating from the continuing operations of all segments of the Group. Result of each segment is defined as turnover of such category less its direct operating expenses but before deduction of unallocated costs. Segment results are presented by amounts of the combined segment results of the Group during the indicative periods: (Restated) (120.4) (144.6) (67.2) The Group’s turnover amounted to RMB41,019.1 million in 2008, up by 2.2% from RMB40,145.5 million for 2007. Turnover from the Group’s freight forwarding services rose 1.5% to RMB32,017.6 million in 2008, compared to RMB31,543.1 million in 2007. Volume of sea freight forwarding containers was 6.687 million TEUs in 2008, increasing 3.2% from 6.481 million TEUs in 2007. Cargo tonnage of air freight forwarding services was RMB0.4215 million tones in 2008, decreasing by 7.0% from RMB0.4534 million tonnes in 2007. Growth in revenue from freight forwarding in 2008 was mainly attributable to the growth in business volume handled by freight forwarding and increase in market price of marine transportation. Turnover of continuing operations from express services for 2008 posted RMB3,522.1 million, increasing by 5.8% from RMB3,327.8 million in 2007. Number of documents and packages handled through continuing operations from express services of the Group was RMB22.45 million units in 2008, a surge of 16.5% over RMB19.27 million units made in 2007. Such growth was mainly attributable to the Group’s efforts to enhance marketing and sales and expand business outlets in our network which contributed to sustained business development. For 2008, turnover from our shipping agency services reached RMB736.4 million, representing an increase of 3.9% from RMB709.0 million for 2007. Number of containers handled in shipping agency business of the Group was 12.85 million TEUs in 2008, an increase of 3.5% from 12.41 million TEUs in 2007. Net registered tonnage of vessels handled by the shipping agency services reached 544.9 million tones in 2008, a 7.9% increase from 504.8 million tones in 2007. Number of vessel calls managed decreases 4.5% to 72,735 times in 2008, compared with 76,201 times in 2007. Growth in the business volume was driven by the Group’s active marketing efforts, development of integrated marketing and sales and reinforced strategic cooperation with shipping companies. In 2008, turnover from storage and terminal services amounted to RMB1,564.0 million, representing a 3.3% growth from RMB1,513.8 million in 2007. The Group’s warehouses handled 10.20 million tonnes of bulk cargo, representing a 1.0% decrease from 10.30 million tonnes for the corresponding period in 2007, containers handled grew to 8.10 million TEUs from 7.70 million TEUs for the corresponding period in 2007, an increase of 5.2%; containers handled in terminals decreased to 2.493 million TEUs from 2.521 million TEUs for the corresponding period in 2007, a decrease of 1.1%, the volume of bulk cargo handled at terminals increased to 8.40 million tonnes from 8.20 million tones for the corresponding period in 2007, an increase of 2.4%. Decrease in the number of containers handled in terminal was mainly attributable to the ongoing coastal line re- construction for certain terminals to enhance operating capacity and the effect of external market changes. Increase in the number of containers handled in container yards was mainly attributable to reinforced partnership with shipping companies and new yards added during the year. Turnover from marine services of the Group in 2008 amounted to RMB3,424.0 million, up 6.1% from RMB3,227.2 million in 2007. Number of containers shipped by the Group rose to 1.809 million TEUs in 2008, up 7.6% from 1.682 million TEUs in Such growth was mainly attributable to structural adjustments to the Group’s transportation capacity and increased capacity in inland routes and short-distance routes coupled with reduced capacity in long-distance routes. Turnover from other services (mainly from trucking and air cargo transportation) in 2008 amounted to RMB939.2 million, an increase of 32.8% from RMB707.2 million in The Group’s trucking of bulk cargo in 2008 was 1,737 thousand tonnes, a decrease of 26.5% from 2,362 thousand tonnes in the corresponding period of 2007. Volume of terminal containers was 983 thousand TEUs, edging up 3.0% from 954 thousand TEUs in 2007. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the increase in average distance for trucking services and new air cargo business in the year. In 2008, transportation and related charges grew by 0.8% to RMB32,706.4 million, compared with RMB32,448.8 million in 2007. Such increase was mainly in line with growth in business volume. Depreciation and amortisation amounted to RMB456.8 million in 2008, representing an increase of 7.9% from RMB423.4 million in 2007, as the Group increased investments in operating and strategic resources to expand its services and market coverage and improve its competitive strengths. Operating Costs (excluding transportation and related charges, depreciation and amortisation, business tax and surcharges) The Group’s operating costs (excluding transportation and related charges, depreciation and amortisation, business tax and surcharges) were RMB6,795.3 million in 2008, a 13.8% increase from RMB5,970.2 million in 2007. The increase in operating costs (excluding transportation and related charges, depreciation and amortisation, business tax and surcharges) reflected rising fuel costs, rental expenses and staff costs. The increase in staff costs was primarily due to the increase in headcounts in line with the development of new business and business outlets expansion in our network. Fuel costs increased by 44.2% comparing to 2007 was owing to rising fuel prices for the first three quarters in the year. The increase in rental expenses by 15.1% comparing to 2007 was attributable to the Group’s focused development of inland trading routes and the integration of the engineering logistics business with the leased vessels business. Other losses (net) increased to RMB282.0 million in 2008 from RMB9.37 million in 2007 as a result of the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by the Group in 2008. To hedge the risks of the shipping route operations associated with rising fuel prices and exchange rate fluctuations, the Group held forward fuel contracts and forward Japanese Yen/USD exchange contract of insignificant amounts. As at the end of 2008, the fair value of the contract recorded a book loss of RMB310 million as a result of the plunge in international crude oil prices and significant appreciation of the Japanese Yen exchange rate. At the end of February 2009, the book loss was reduced to RMB170 million. The Group’s operating profit was RMB797.8 million in 2008, representing a decrease of 37.9% from RMB1,285.7 million in 2007. Operating profit for 2008 decreased to 1.9% from 3.2% in 2007 as a percentage of total revenue, or to 9.2% from 16.0% as a percentage of net revenue (total revenue less transportation and related charges), primarily as a result of lower profit compared to the same period last year for all operations of the Company under an unfavourable macro-economic environment in the second half of 2008. In 2008, income tax expense of the Group amounted to RMB471.8 million, representing an increase of 24.0% from RMB380.5 million in 2007. The increase was mainly attributable to income tax payable in respect of gains arising from the disposal of Exel-Sinotrans Freight Forwarding Company Limited (“Exel-Sinotrans”), a jointly controlled entity. Income tax expense as a percentage of profit before income tax expense increased to 36.0% from 29.4% for Discontinued operations of the Group represented the UPS related express business. The non-competition period relating to the UPS business expired on 31 December 2007. UPS related income had been fully dealt with by 31 December 2007. Minority interests for 2008 amounted to RMB269.9 million, down 11.7% from RMB305.8 million for 2007, which was primarily attributable to decreased profit for the period of Sinoair, a non-wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. Profit after income tax from the Group’s continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounted to RMB838.5 million, representing a decrease of 8.4% from RMB915.3 million for the same period in 2007. The Group’s profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounted to RMB568.6 million, representing a decrease of 32.2% from RMB839.0 million for the same period in 2007. Liquidity of the Group is mainly derived from cash flow from its operations. The following table summarises the Group’s cash flows for each of the two years ended 31 December 2008 and (Restated) (2,118.5) (1,459.1) (102.4) Net cash inflow generated from operating activities for 2008 amounted to RMB1,359.7 million, up 80.0% compared with RMB755.5 million in 2007.

The average age of trade receivables for 2008 and 2007 were 50 days and 53 days respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2008, net cash used in investing activities of RMB2,118.6 million primarily comprised RMB1,539.6 million for the addition of property, plant and equipment, RMB15.1 million for the acquisition of intangible assets, RMB183.3 million for the acquisition of land use rights, RMB152.9 million for the acquisition of remaining equity interests in subsidiaries and associates, and an additional RMB768.4 million in term deposits with initial terms of over three months, which were partially offset by an increase of RMB540.5 million in net cash received for the disposal of a jointly controlled entity during the year. For the year ended 31 December 2007, net cash used in investing activities was RMB1,459.1 million, comprising primarily of RMB1,034.6 million for the addition of property, plant and equipment, RMB15.5 million for the acquisition of intangible assets, RMB234.7 million for the acquisition of land use rights, RMB165.9 million for the acquisition of subsidiaries, remaining equity interests in subsidiaries and associates and RMB550.0 million for the prepayment of consideration for acquisition, which were partially offset by a decrease of RMB451.6 million in term deposits with initial terms of over three months. Net cash generated from the Group’s financing activities amounted to RMB773.6 million for 2008, compared with net cash used in financing activities of RMB601.2 million for 2007. New bank borrowings in 2008 amounted to RMB4,250.5 million (2007: RMB2,323.1 million) were partially offset by repayments of bank borrowings of RMB3,187.7 million (2007: RMB1,139.3 million) and dividend payment of RMB346.0 million (2007: RMB353.7 million). For 2008, the Group’s capital expenditure amounted to RMB1,738.0 million, consisting primarily of RMB1,539.6 million for acquisition of property, plant and equipment, RMB15.1 million for the acquisition of intangible assets and RMB183.3 million for purchase of land use rights.

As at 31 December 2008, contingent liabilities mainly comprised outstanding lawsuits of the Group arising in its ordinary course of business, which amounted to RMB55.34 million (2007: RMB10.85 million). As at 31 December 2008, the amount of guarantees provided by the Group on behalf of benefit of customers was RMB2 million (2007: the amount of business guarantees the Group issued for the jointly controlled entities was RMB3 million). As at 31 December 2008, the Group pledged restricted cash amounting to approximately RMB438.4 million for borrowings. In addition, as at the same date, the Group also pledged property, plant and equipment (having a net book value of approximately RMB455.2 million) and land use rights (having a net book value of approximately RMB22.145 million) for borrowings. As at 31 December 2008, the gearing ratio of the Group was 60.5% (2007: 56.5%), which was arrived at by dividing the sum of total liabilities and minority interests by total assets of the Group as at 31 December 2008. Since a substantial portion of the Group’s turnover and transportation and related charges is denominated in US dollars, the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is mainly related to US dollars. The Group could not assure that future fluctuations in Renminbi against the US dollars and other currencies would not adversely affect its results and financial position (including the ability to declare dividends). The extent of the Group’s credit risk exposure is represented by the aggregated balance of trade and other receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to- maturity financial assets, available-for-sale financial assets, restricted cash and term deposits with initial terms of over three months. The maximum credit risk exposure in the event that other parties fail to perform their obligations under these financial instruments is the carrying values of these financial instruments. At the end of 2008, the Group (the Company together with its subsidiaries) had 24,084 (2007: 21,775) employees. The Company has formed an integrated system comprising the job position regime, the remuneration regime and the performance management regime. The remuneration regime includes long-term incentive schemes. The three regimes have combined to form an effective incentive and check mechanism compatible with the strategic objectives and business characteristics of the Company to support a corporate culture highlighted by the priority of results and performance. Employees are encouraged to improve their capabilities and performance on an ongoing basis, thereby facilitating the Company’s healthy and sustainable development. The Group has also increased its efforts in staff training and development with due emphasis on career advancement and planning to assure opportunities for individual growth of employees. At Sinotrans, we believe that people come first and that employees should be taken good care of. By assuring reasonable allocation of human resources, we endeavour to provide employees with good working environment as well as opportunities for development, thereby enhancing team spirit and staff creativity to facilitate mutual development of the Company and its employees in harmony. On 1 January 2008, the Group completed its acquisitions from its ultimate holding company, Sinotrans Group Company, certain companies, assets and businesses, which primarily engage in freight forwarding, shipping agency, storage and terminal services for an aggregate cash consideration of RMB1,106 million. The companies acquired include: Sinotrans Chongqing Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Anhui Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Foshan Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Shandong Tsingdao International Logistics Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Jiangxi Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Haixing Harbour Development Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Ruichi Logistics Co., Ltd., Jingmao International Transportation Co., Ltd., Sinotrans (Hong Kong) Logistics Co., Ltd. and Guangdong Changyun International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd.. In April 2008, Sinoair disposed of its entire 50% equity interests in Exel-Sinotrans to DHL Exel Supply Chain (Hong Kong) Limited for a total cash consideration of Euro which was equivalent to RMB658,070,000. Macro-economic conditions look complex in 2009, as the Company is expected to face a severe business environment in terms of economic situations at home and abroad as well as the general outlook for the logistics and transportation industry. In view of this, it is imperative that we fully appreciate the situation and respond in a proactive manner. While the severity of the present crisis should not be under- estimated, we should nonetheless capitalise on all favourable factors and possible opportunities for development. In 2009, the Group’s operations will follow the principles of “clarifying directions, accelerating adjustments, striving for progress and procuring development”. First of all, we must emphasise development, which is the perpetual theme underpinning our efforts. Secondly, we also need to cater to adjustments. Business structure adjustments and business model optimisation need to be implemented with greater intensity, driving for innovations and new modes of development. Thirdly, we should revisit our management. Risk controls should continue and management of details should be resolutely implemented for the benefit of improved operational quality. To effectively cope with the impact of the global economic recession, the Company will adopt the following measures to enhance its competitiveness: Our traditional businesses will be reinforced with optimisations and adjustments. Marketing efforts will be strengthened to increase the proportion of direct customers and enhance development of emerging markets. Our business structure will be further adjusted and optimised to enhance the ability of our freight- forwarding business to provide one-stop services and value-added services. Joint marine and rail transportation as well as engineering project transportation will be actively developed to increase our edge via differentiation. The import business will be vigorously developed to increase the proportion of the import business and carve out new growth niche. Network building will continue to be enhanced with a view to stronger synergies. We will seek to improve our operating quality by fully leveraging our network strengths. Major efforts will be devoted to the development of the domestic market following government initiatives to stimulate domestic demand. While reinforcing our traditional markets, we will also further develop our domestic logistics and trade transportation business and tap the demand-driven domestic market as an important aspect for our future development and a strategic measure to optimise growth. Efforts in specialisation and intensified operations will be enhanced. We intend to engage in intensive development of the market for specialised logistics and strengthen our ability in systems integration and intensified operations, including chemical logistics, free-trade logistics and military industry logistics. Strategic planning will be resolutely implemented and structural adjustments will be conducted in greater depth. Market corrections in the macro-economy should present us with opportunities to resolve institutional and structural issues through further internal adjustments in the implementation of our plans. Opportune investments will be made with prudent control over investment scale, assuring the acquisition of quality assets that would enhance the core competitiveness of our principal business. We will continue to work on the optimisation of resource allocation to increase our efficiency in the use of resources. Management of details will be pursued in greater depth with a view to stringent cost control. Stringent risk control will be exercised and measures will be taken to complement our long-term mechanism for risk control. We will be facing more daunting challenges in 2009 given the severe economic environment. By persisting in a prudent development strategy, nevertheless, we are confident that the Company will sustain healthy growth in its operating results to deliver greater value to its shareholders.

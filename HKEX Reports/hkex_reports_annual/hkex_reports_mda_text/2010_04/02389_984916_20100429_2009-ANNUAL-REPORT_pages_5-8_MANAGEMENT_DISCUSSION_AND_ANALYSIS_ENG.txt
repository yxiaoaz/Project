The PRC economy has grown significantly since the PRC Government introduced reforms in the late 1970’s, and its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has further accelerated the reform of the PRC economy. Over the years there has been tremendous economic growth, increase in disposable income and the increase in urbanization, these factors support a sustaining growth of the property market in China. In line with the growth in the economy and population of the Jiangsu Province, housing demand in Jiangsu Province experienced an upward trend in recent years. Similarly the property market in Shanghai still experiences a strong demand with price maintaining at high level. Although the central government has put forward a number of measures aim at controlling the rapid growth of the property market, we did not see any major adjustment in the market price or any significant decrease in the market. In 2009, a number of measures introduced by the PRC government were proved to be effective and successful, as noted from an incipient recovery in the domestic economy, and a stable economic growth. However, the domestic raw material prices have kept rising since last year. In particular, copper prices rose by more than 100%, while prices for aluminum, steel, plastic and other materials increased by over 20%. Given increasingly furious market competition, businesses were placed under gross margin pressures. These factors have exposed the manufacturing industry which focused on the main business of power tools to greater challenges in 2009. During the year under review, the exports of domestic power tools were weighed down by the slowdown in the economic recovery outside the PRC, especially in leading markets including Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. The situation was particularly noticeable in Europe. As people in European and American countries are enthusiastic about DIY, and the economic environment there is recovering gradually, both the Europe and North America will be the main engines for driving the growth of the exports of the power tools for a long period of time. In addition, the professional tool users still accounted for over 60% of the overall power tools market in 2009. As professional power tools are of higher grade and added value, it is expected that professional power tools will continue to secure majority market share of the power tools business in The development of the Shanghai property project is progressing smoothly and the southern portion shall be ready for pre-sale by the third quarter this year and construction work to complete in 2011. In respect of the northern portion pre-sale is expected to start in the fourth quarter this year. On January 2010, a subsidiary of the Company won an open tender to acquire the land use right of a land in Jiangzu province for RMB445,480,000. The Company has set up a joint venture company with a Shanghai property developer in which the Company owns 70%, to jointly develop this project. For details of this acquisition please refer Company. The Group exercised more mature operational management in 2009 when compared with previous years, thus laying a solid foundation for future development. During the review period, the domestic economy was gradually picking up, but the economic growth outside the PRC was relatively slow. In view that domestic raw material prices continued to rise, the overall product costs of the manufacturing industry were increasing. During the year under review, the Group took active and effective measures to adjust the enterprise development strategies in order to maintain a stable development of the Group. In 2009, the Group’s turnover and loss attributable to shareholders were approximately HK$104,963,000 and HK$45,930,000. In 2009, power tool business remained the Group’s main source of income, while the proportion of other businesses decreased. During the year under review, the Group reaped more notable success in its market development. The Group has attained initial progress in the aspects of market exploration and balanced development. As such, the Company’s business is no longer over-dependent on a single market by gradually achieving a balanced development and enhancing the Company’s ability to resist risks. Currently, the Group’s corporate customers are expanding. Our main customers include the world famous chain stores and major electrical distributors in Europe and the United States such as BOSCH, SPARKY, KINGFISHER and TTI. To tap into growing global demand for power tools along with the gradual recovery, during the year under review, the Group fully integrated and enhanced incentive policies of R&D and sales management, in order to step up the lead time and cycle of product launch and marketing by R&D team and key sales personnel, and to extend the influence of our products in the global market. At the same time, the Company focused on advantageous resources by strengthening R&D and marketing efforts on major products, while reducing a small number of lower-margin products. Therefore, we ultimately achieved the desired results for foreign sales during the year under review. Despite of slow recovery in foreign markets, sales growth of major customers of the Company was still relatively encouraging, with a number of projects proceeding to substantial R&D and hence to bulk production. In 2009, the Group continued to strengthen the internal management systems for its plants and successfully passed management system certificates such as ISO9001: 2008, ISO14001: 2004 and GB/T28001-2001 awarded by CQC. ERP based modules were fully put into practice in the plants of the Group. Thus, the management of our plants was much improved during the year under review.

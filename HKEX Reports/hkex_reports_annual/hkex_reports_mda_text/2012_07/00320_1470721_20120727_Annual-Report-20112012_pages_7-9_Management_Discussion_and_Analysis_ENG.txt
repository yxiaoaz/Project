The Group’s turnover for the Year amounted to HK$2,428,804,000, decreasing by approximately 8.8% from last year. The consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company was HK$33,252,000 for the Year, compared to HK$56,572,000 for the year ended 31 March 2011. Basic earnings per share for the Year amounted to 4.0 HK cents, compared to 6.8 HK cents for the same period in last year. Turnover of the Group amounted to HK$2,428,804,000 for the Year, representing a decrease of 8.8% over last year. The decrease in turnover was mainly due to the volatile global economy and the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which further intensified in the second half of the year. The Group recorded modest growth in turnover in the Appliance Controls and Commercial and Industrial Controls businesses due to diversification into the Mainland China domestic market and the successful launch of new products by certain existing and new customers. Nevertheless, this growth was offset by a decrease in sales of approximately HK$273,399,000 or 27.2% in the Building and Home Controls business due primarily to weakness in the US housing market, resulting in soft demand for customer products. Consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company decreased from HK$56,572,000 to HK$33,252,000 for the Year, representing a decrease of 41.2%. Excluding the effect of a tax credit of HK$13,241,000 recorded in last year, the Group’s consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the Company was HK$43,331,000 for the year ended 31 March 2011 compared to HK$33,252,000 for the Year. The decrease in turnover during the Year leading to the overall decrease in the Group’s results; however, the gross profit margin remained stable at approximately 11%. With continuing increases in production and overhead costs due to inflation, increases in labour costs in Mainland China and appreciation of the Renminbi (“RMB”), the Group still managed to maintain its gross margin through control of overheads and continuous improvement in operational efficiency. As a result, operating expenses decreased by HK$13,750,000 to HK$238,692,000 during the Year. The decrease in segment margin for both the Appliance Controls and Commercial and Industrial Controls businesses largely resulted from the increased production and overhead costs during the Year. Segment margin for the Building and Home Controls business improved to 1.9%, compared to 1.1% last year, primarily due to improvement in branded business and a decrease in sales of relatively low margin products. The ongoing impact of the European debt crisis and the uncertainties in the global economy, especially in Europe and the USA, will continue to constrain overall customer demand in the coming financial year. Rising costs in the operating environment with increases in wages, inflation and appreciation of the RMB remain challenges for manufacturers in Mainland China. To withstand these unfavorable factors, the Group will continue tight cost controls and seek further improvement in operational efficiency and productivity to minimise the adverse impact on margins. The Group will also continue its efforts to reposition products and markets through a stronger product mix derived from the rollout of smart energy and wireless innovations. In addition, as part of that repositioning plan, the Group will consolidate its expansion into the growing market in Mainland China to drive business growth in the coming year. The Group maintained a sound financial and liquidity position during the Year. As at 31 March 2012, the Group had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of HK$632,211,000, the majority of which were denominated either in US dollars or Hong Kong dollars and HK$282,381,000 were denominated in RMB. The Group’s current ratio remained strong at 2.0 times. As at 31 March 2012, total interest-bearing bank and other borrowings were HK$230,659,000, comprised primarily of bank loans and overdrafts repayable within one year. The majority of these borrowings were denominated either in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Sterling or Euro and the interest rates applied were primarily subject to floating rate terms. As at 31 March 2012, total equity attributable to owners of the Company amounted to HK$1,037,597,000. The Group had a net cash balance of HK$401,552,000, representing total cash and cash equivalents less total interest-bearing bank and other borrowings such that no gearing ratio applies. The majority of the Group’s sales and purchases are denominated in US dollars and Hong Kong dollars with Sterling and Euro comprising a lesser extent. Due to the fact that the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, the Group’s exposure to this foreign exchange risk is relatively low. Certain production and operating overheads of the Group’s production facilities in Mainland China are denominated in RMB. As at 31 March 2012, the Group did not have any outstanding financial instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Nevertheless, the Group will closely monitor its overall foreign exchange exposure and interest rate exposure and will adopt a proactive but prudent approach to minimize the relevant exposures where necessary. During the Year, the Group incurred total capital expenditures of approximately HK$60,133,000 for additions to property, plant and equipment as well as for deferred expenditures for the development of new products. As at 31 March 2012, the Group had contracted but not provided for capital commitments, mainly for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, of HK$1,119,000. A subsidiary of the Company is involved in a dispute with a third party, who is alleging that the subsidiary has infringed patent and is seeking for value in dispute of EUR937,500 (equivalent to approximately HK$9,713,000). The decision of the relevant district court dated 19 January 2012 was favourable to the subsidiary and the third party has appealed the decision to the relevant higher regional court. Taking into consideration the advice from the Group’s lawyer, the directors consider the subsidiary has valid defense against the claim and therefore no provision was made as at 31 March 2012. As at 31 March 2012, no bank deposit and other assets had been pledged to secure the Group’s banking facilities. As at 31 March 2012, the Group had a total of approximately 3,700 full-time employees. Total staff costs for the Year amounted to HK$252,014,000. Salaries and wages are generally reviewed on an annual basis in accordance with individual qualifications and performance, the Group’s results and market conditions. The Group provides year-end double pay, discretionary bonus, medical insurance, provident fund, educational subsidy and training to its employees. The Company has also adopted a share option scheme under which the Company can grant options to, inter alia, employees of the Group to subscribe for shares of the Company with a view to rewarding those who have contributed to the Group and encouraging employees to work towards enhancing the value of the Company and its shares for the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Up to the date of this annual report, 17,476,000 share options remained outstanding under such share option scheme. The proceeds from the Company’s issue of new shares (including shares issued on the exercise of over-allotment option) for listing on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) in October 2006, after deduction of related expenses, amounted to approximately HK$469,419,000. The Group intends to apply the net proceeds for the purposes as set out in the section headed “Future Plans and Use of Proceeds” in the prospectus of the Company dated 25 September 2006. As at 31 March 2012, approximately HK$114,000,000 had been utilized for strategic business combination and acquisitions, approximately HK$20,950,000 for the expansion of the distribution network, approximately HK$44,176,000 for the repayment of bank borrowings and approximately HK$44,176,000 for general corporate purposes, and the remaining balance of the net proceeds had been placed in certain financial institutions and licensed banks in Hong Kong as short-term deposits.

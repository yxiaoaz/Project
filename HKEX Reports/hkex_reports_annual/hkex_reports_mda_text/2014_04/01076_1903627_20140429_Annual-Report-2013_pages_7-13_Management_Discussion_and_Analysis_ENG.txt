During the year, the Group continued to engage principally in processing and trading of frozen and functional food products which are sold mainly to the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”), Hong Kong and Canada. The Group continued to utilise the food processing facilities of the food processing plant in Jiangmen, the PRC, which was leased under an operating lease agreement (the “Sincere Gold Agreement”) entered into with an independent third party. During the year, some major countries with markets for frozen food products continued to suffer from economic hardship and pressure on global food trades and therefore affecting the performance of the Group. Especially, fluctuation and continuous downward trend in selling prices have been exerting pressure on the business volume and gross margin of the Group. Besides, under the challenging operating environment in 2013, allowance for trade receivables of approximately HK$2,200,000 (2012: nil) and allowance for inventories of approximately HK$1,846,000 (2012: nil) were made during the year. In addition, due to keen competition from other food processing plants, no food processing service was provided by the Group to outside customers and no food processing income was recorded during the year (2012: income of approximately HK$6,810,000). Selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses were increased during the year 2013 as additional resources were applied for developing the distribution networks in the PRC and Hong Kong. These factors adversely affected the financial results of the Group and loss of approximately HK$14,953,000 was incurred for the year. However, it is encouraging that the Group began its first supply of frozen food products to one of the leading supermarket channel in Hong Kong, namely PARKnSHOP, during the year. Annual Report 2013 Looking forward, with (i) the uncertain world economy that is anticipated to continue; (ii) the keen competition from other food traders; and (iii) the tightening standard on food safety, it is expected that there will be pressure on the performance in terms of both business volume and gross profit margin of the Group. To cope with these unfavorable market situations, the Group will continue to cautiously operate its frozen foods trading business and will focus on developing its food distribution platform to build up its sales network. In addition, the Group has been regularly reviewing the Sincere Gold Agreement with the food processing plant in Jiangmen, the PRC, in order to maintain operating efficiency for the food processing business of the Group and will continue to prudently implement the above strategies for the benefit of the Group and the shareholders of the Company. It is in the Directors’ opinion that the business with PARKnSHOP, which began in 2013, will enhance the image and recognition of the Group’s products which will be benefited to its frozen foods business in the long run. On 19 March 2014, the Company completed the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the entire issued share capital of and shareholder’s loan to Excel Earth Limited (“Excel Earth”) and obtained the profit guarantee given by the vendor (the “Profit Guarantee”). The principal asset of Excel Earth is its interests under, and entitlements to, the transfer of five percent (5%) of the distributable profit of Hang Seng Sociedade Unipessoal Limitada, for each twelve-month period (the “Profit Transfer”), which has commenced on 1 January 2014. Details of the Acquisition have been disclosed in the circular of the Company dated 8 January By virtue of the Profit Transfer and the Profit Guarantee, it is expected that the Group will receive a secured and guaranteed annual income of HK$25 million on average with substantial upside potential over a period of 16 years. The applicable guaranteed profit share for the year ending 2014 is HK$24 million. BUSINESS OUTLOOK (Continued) As disclosed in the announcement of the Company dated 24 February 2014, the Directors have recently been in preliminary contacts and discussions with certain parties in relation to several eco-tourism, entertainment and gaming businesses. The Board does not rule out the possibility that the Company may carry out debt and/or equity fund raising plan(s) to improve its financial position in the event that suitable fund raising opportunities arise and/or to satisfy the financing needs arising out of any business development of the Group. The Company will, as and when appropriate, comply with all relevant requirements, and where necessary, make further announcement(s) in accordance with the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities (the “Listing Rules”) on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”) if any investment opportunities or fund raising events are substantiated. For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group recorded a turnover of approximately HK$544,824,000, decreased by approximately HK$106,738,000 or 16.4% with gross profit of approximately HK$9,697,000, decreased by approximately HK$15,807,000 or 62.0%. The decrease in turnover and gross profit was mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and selling price to major frozen food products market as there was weak demand in frozen meat and poultry as well as keen competition faced. During the year, due to keen competition from other food processing plants, no food processing income was derived in 2013 (2012: income of approximately HK$6,810,000). Besides, the Group made a specific provision on certain slow-moving inventories and allowance for inventories of approximately HK$1,846,000 was made in 2013 (2012: nil). In addition, as at 31 December 2013, an allowance for trade receivables of approximately HK$2,200,000 was made for overdue receivables with aging period over 1 year. As a result of the decrease in turnover, gross profit and absence of food processing income together with the provision and allowance made, the Group incurred loss from operations of approximately HK$14,951,000 for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: profit from operations of approximately HK$19,412,000).

Save for the Acquisition, the Company did not have any significant investment, acquisition or disposal during the year that should be notified to the shareholders of the Company.

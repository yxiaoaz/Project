In 2013, both the global economy and the textile and garment industry have shown signs of recovery. In particular, the performance of the linen textile industry was one of the best in the textile and garment industry. Thanks to the continuous promotion of linen yarn/ fabric application in recent years, the linen textile market has seen gradual expansion in scale. According to the statistics of the China Bast and Leaf Fibers Textile Association, the linen yarn export of China amounted to US$245 million in 2013, representing a year- on-year increase of 6.8%. In spite of the saturation of the existing production capacity and the impact of the rainstorm and flood brought by typhoon Fitow in October 2013, the Group continued to dominate the industry and remained the largest Chinese linen yarn exporter for 11 consecutive years. The Group’s linen yarn exports in 2013 accounted for 29.3% of the total export from China and topped the industry. The application of linen yarn was restricted to high-end fashion and home textiles in the past due to the limited raw material supply and primitive production technology. However, as advances in the technology for linen yarn spinning and linen fabric manufacturing brought about new products and applications, the use of linen textiles in fast fashion has since been growing. As international fast fashion brands began to embrace different kinds of linen textiles, such as linen/cotton and linen/wool blend fabrics, the demand of linen grew substantially. For the year 2013, the Group’s turnover was RMB761,915,000 (2012: RMB718,912,000), representing an increase of 6.0% compared to last year. Gross profit dropped by 1.2% year-on-year to RMB206,883,000 (2012: RMB209,300,000). Thanks to its leading market position, the Group enjoys pricing power in the market. Such power allows the Group to increase the average selling price in the year to counter part of the impact of rising labor costs in China. As a result, gross profit margin stood at 27.2% (2012: 29.1%). The Group’s profit attributable to owners of the parent increased by 6.6% year-on-year to RMB100,438,000 (2012: RMB94,180,000). Basic earnings per share amounted to RMB0.16. To reciprocate the shareholders for their continued support, the Board has recommended the payment of a final dividend of HK7.5 cents per ordinary share (2012: HK7 cents per ordinary share). 2013 Annual Report With a sales network covering over 20 countries and regions around the world, the Group established a branch company in Italy and 5 brand agencies located in Turkey, Portugal, India and Korea. For the year ended 31 December 2013, domestic sales amounted to RMB283,393,000, representing a surge of 19% year-on-year, and accounted for approximately 37% of the Group’s total turnover, while overseas sales accounted for 63% of the total turnover. In terms of export amount, the European Union remained the largest export market of the Group and accounted for 40% of the Group’s total export sales, followed by Korea, Turkey and India, successively. Among these countries, emerging markets such as Korea and India demonstrated the most significant growth during the Year. Sales of linen yarn to the Indian market jumped from RMB45,624,000 in 2012 to RMB66,353,000 in 2013, up by 45%. The demand for linen products in India has been rising in recent years due to the rapid growth of the Indian economy and consumption market as well as the tropical climate. It is expected that the demand for linen products from India will continue to surge. Meanwhile, demand from garment producers such as China, Turkey and Portugal will also keep growing due to the boom in fast fashion industry. During the year ended 31 December 2013, prices of the Group’s raw material, linen fiber, was largely stable. The Group mainly sources its linen fiber from well-established origins such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Being one of the largest buyers in these origins, the Group enjoys better bargaining power and has a cost advantage. Furthermore, the Group has implemented a timely procurement strategy in order to secure stable supply and prices of linen fiber. The Group’s raw material production base in Xinjiang mainly produces organic linen, with an annual production of 702 tonnes in 2013, and contributes approximately 4% of the Group’s total raw material supply. As at 31 December 2013, the Group had an aggregate annual production capacity of 13,000 tonnes, with two production bases located in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province and Rugao City, Jiangsu Province. The Group’s production line is now nearly saturated. In order to capture the opportunity brought by the growing demand in linen products, the Group has completed the construction of the third production base in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province. As at the date of this announcement, the new plant has been put into fine tuning stage. Trial and formal production are scheduled to start in March and in the middle of the second quarter, respectively, of 2014. By then, the annual production capacity of the Group will increase significantly by 38% from 13,000 tonnes now to 18,000 tonnes. This new production base will be equipped with the latest technologies and facilities, including power equipment and energy management solutions provided by Siemens. Compared with the existing bases, the new production base will command higher production efficiency and save more energy and water, thereby helping the Group to reduce costs in the current operating environment against the ever rising energy and water prices.

A new product, dope-dyed linen yarn, was launched in 2013 and is being marketed. In 2014, it will be rigorously promoted through the Group’s overseas agency network and in industrial conferences. Furthermore, in view of the rising market demand for environmental-friendly, natural and organic products, the Group has taken the lead in establishing trial plantation of organic linen in Xinjiang for organic linen yarn products. The gross profit margin of these products is relatively high. In the coming year, the Group may enlarge the production of organic linen yarn depending on market demand so as to diversify its product portfolio and enhance its overall profitability. The domestic linen yarn market is maturing. More and more domestic garment retail chains include garments made of linen fabrics in their collections. The market has shifted from processing and export to domestic consumption. The Group will further penetrate the domestic market in 2014.

Given its rise as an emerging market for linen products, Japan is expected to make a greater contribution to the Group’s sales in the future. The Group will strengthen its ties with customers across the world by organizing industrial and technology exchange conferences in order to obtain first-hand market information, thereby enhancing its research and development capacity and techniques, bolstering its customer relations and securing business growth at home and abroad.

The following management discussion and analysis is based on IFRS ﬁ nancial statements data. We are a leading China-based construction machinery manufacturer providing comprehensive and diversiﬁ ed products and value-added services and have experienced signiﬁ cant growth in the last decade beneﬁ ting from China’s ongoing urbanization and signiﬁ cant growth in the infrastructure sector. Our product lines include: (i) concrete machinery, (ii) crane machinery, (iii) environmental and sanitation machinery, (iv) road construction and pile foundation machinery, (v) earth working machinery, and (vi) ﬁ nance lease services. been expressed as a percentage of our consolidated turnover. (in millions, except for percentages) (70.83) (67.70) (0.13) (0.21) (9.42) (7.02) (7.01) (4.93) (1.48) (1.21) (0.57) (1.48) (2.76) Attributable to: We generate turnover primarily from the following operating segments: Concrete machinery; Crane machinery; Environmental and sanitation machinery; Road construction and pile foundation machinery; Finance lease services. The following table sets forth the breakdown of our consolidated turnover by our operating segments, and each expressed as a percentage of our consolidated turnover, for 2013: (in millions, except for percentages) Our turnover decreased by 19.82% from RMB48,071 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB38,542 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. In 2013, China’s macro-economy saw a sluggish recovery while economic growth remained lackluster. Due to weak market demand, increasing overproduction and intensifying competition, the Chinese construction machinery industry fell into stagnation. The Company has timely adjusted its overall operating strategy and development approach by simulating joint-stock system reform, maintaining stringent control on operational risks and implementing effective cost reduction and efﬁ ciency enhancement, thereby strengthening its operation. In particular, our turnover from sales of concrete machinery decreased by 27.14% from RMB23,596 million for 2012 to RMB17,191 million for 2013, primarily due to shrinking market demand and intensifying competition. Our turnover from sales of crane machinery fell by 11.7% from RMB14,132 million for 2012 to RMB12,479 million for 2013 primarily due to an overall decrease in market demand for cranes. Turnover from sales of earth working machinery dropped by 65.98% from RMB2,269 million for 2012 to RMB772 million for 2013 primarily due to several large orders recorded in 2012 and a weak market in 2013. as a percentage of our consolidated turnover, for 2013: (in millions, except for percentages) expressed as a percentage of our consolidated turnover, for 2013: (in millions, except for percentages) Our cost of sales and services primarily consists of: Raw materials, i.e., costs of raw materials, parts and components, including steel, branded chassis, hydraulic parts and components, engines, tires and electric controls, and a variety of other raw materials and fabricated or manufactured components; Staff costs, including salaries and beneﬁ ts for personnel directly involved in manufacturing activities; Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment used for manufacturing purposes; Costs of ﬁ nance lease services, including fees, other surcharges and interest related to factoring of receivables Others, including manufacturing overhead, such as maintenance of production equipment and utility costs, including electricity, steam and water and costs associated with waste treatment. The following table sets forth the major components of our cost of sales and services both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total cost of sales and services for 2013: (in millions, except for percentages) Costs of raw materials, parts and components account for the majority of our cost of sales and services. each expressed as a percentage of total cost of sales and services for 2013: (in millions, except for percentages) Total cost of sales and services of Due to the decrease in the volume of the Company’s sales, our cost of sales and services reduced by 16.12% from RMB32,546 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB27,300 million for the year ended 31 December 2013, which was basically in line with the decrease in our sales and production volume. The following table sets forth the gross proﬁ t and gross proﬁ t margin breakdown by operating segments, for the periods indicated: (in millions, except for percentages) Our gross proﬁ t decreased by 27.59% from RMB15,525 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB11,242 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Our gross proﬁ t margin decreased from 32.30% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 29.17% for the year ended 31 December 2013. Our other revenues and net gain decreased from the net loss of RMB101 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to a net loss of RMB49 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 primarily attributable to a drop in the discount of the non-recourse factoring of our trade receivables caused by a decrease in the factored amount and the decrease in government subsidies. Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 7.55% from RMB3,376 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB3,631 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our consolidated turnover increased from 7.02% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 9.42% for the year ended 31 December 2013 primarily due to the fact that the Company was unable to achieve its sales target set at the beginning of the year and hence the allocation of the sales resources were not commensurate with the expected target. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 14.06% from RMB2,368 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB2,701 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of our consolidated turnover increased from 4.93% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 7.01% for the year ended 31 December 2013 primarily due to an increase in the provisions for receivables during the period. Our research and development expenses decreased by 2.40% from RMB584 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB570 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. As a result of the foregoing, our proﬁ t from operations dropped by 52.83% from RMB9,096 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB4,291 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Our operating margin fell from 18.92% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 11.13% for the year ended 31 December 2013. Due to the increase of exchange gains in 2013, we had net ﬁ nancial gains of RMB195 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Our income tax expenses dropped by 57.11% from RMB1,329 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB570 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 primarily due to a drop in sales and thus a decrease in our taxable income. Our effective income tax rate decreased from 15.00% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 12.59% for the year ended 31 December 2013, which was mainly attributable to the fact that more favourable tax preferences were provided by the government. As a result of the foregoing, our proﬁ t for the year decreased by 47.44% from RMB7,529 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 to RMB3,957 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Our net proﬁ t margin dropped from 15.66% for the year ended 31 December 2012 to 10.27% for the year ended 31 December As a result of the foregoing, our proﬁ t attributable to equity shareholders of the Company decreased by 47.56% from RMB7,330 million for 2012 to RMB3,844 million for 2013. During 2013, we ﬁ nanced our operations primarily through cash proceeds from our operations, proceeds from loans and borrowings, including bank borrowings and factored trade receivables, proceeds from non- public offering of A share and global offering of H shares and proceeds from the ﬁ rst and second issuances of guaranteed USD denominated bonds in 2012. As of 31 December 2013, we had RMB16,657 million in cash and cash equivalents, most of which were denominated in Renminbi. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash and demand deposits. The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash ﬂ ows for 2013: (million) In 2013, net cash generated from operating activities was RMB43 million derived primarily from the proﬁ t before taxation of RMB4,527 million, adjusted to reﬂ ect the interest expenses of RMB970 million and depreciation and amortization of RMB562 million, after deducting the following items: (i) the increase in trade and other receivables of RMB8,086 million; (ii) the decrease in trade and other payables of RMB720 million; and (iii) the income tax payment of RMB1,379 million, and then adding back the decrease in receivables under ﬁ nance lease of RMB2,543 million and the decrease in inventories of RMB3,041 million. In 2013, net cash used in investing activities was RMB692 million, consisting primarily of: (i) payments for the purchases of property, plant and equipment of RMB853 million; and (ii) an increase in pledged bank deposits of RMB292 million. The property, plant and equipment were purchased for the construction of our industrial parks, manufacturing facility upgrades and renovation projects in 2013. The balance of pledged bank deposits increased due to an increase in various deposits of the Company. In 2013, net cash used in ﬁ nancing activities was RMB2,754 million, consisting primarily of the proceeds from loans and borrowings of RMB12,175 million, offset by repayments of loans and borrowings of RMB10,924 million, dividends paid to equity shareholders of RMB1,540 million and interest payments of RMB956 million, and payment on the acquisition of minority interest of RMB1,469 million. For the year ended 31 December 2013, our capital expenditures for the purchases of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and lease prepayments amounted to RMB1,587 million. As at 31 December 2013, our commitments consisted of capital commitments that have been authorized and contracted for in the amount of RMB711 million, capital commitments that have been authorized but not contracted for in the amount of RMB94 million and operating lease commitments of RMB400 million, of which RMB133 million was payable within one year. As at 31 December 2013, we had contingent liabilities of RMB15,044 million in connection with our ﬁ nancial guarantees provided for bank loans obtained by certain of our customers to ﬁ nance their purchases of our products. Under the guarantee contracts, if the customers defaulted, we are entitled to repossess the products purchased by the customers which were held as collaterals. For the year ended 31 December 2013, due to our customers’ default, we paid RMB447 million to the banks under our guarantees. Certain of ﬁ nance lease contracts between us and our end-user customers are jointly arranged by our leasing subsidiaries and a third-party leasing company. Under the joint leasing arrangement, we provide guarantees to the third-party leasing company so that if the customers defaulted, we may be called upon to repay the leasing company for its share of the outstanding lease payments due from the respective customers. At the same time, we will be entitled to repossess and resell the leased machinery, and retain any excess of the sale proceeds over the guaranteed amount that we paid the leasing company. As at 31 December 2013, our maximum exposure to such guarantees was RMB142 million. The term of the guarantees is generally in line with the term of the leasing contracts, ranging from two to ﬁ ve years. For the year ended 31 December 2013, we paid RMB64 million to the third-party leasing company for repossession of machinery under the guarantee arrangement as a result of customer default. Starting from 1 January 2013, certain customers of the Group ﬁ nance their purchase of the Group’s machinery products through ﬁ nance leases provided by third-party leasing companies. Under the third party leasing arrangement, the Group provides guarantee to the third-party leasing companies that in the event of customer default, the Group is required to make payment to the leasing companies for the outstanding lease payments due from the customer. At the same time, the Group is entitled to repossess and sell the leased machinery, and retain any net proceeds in excess of the guarantee payments made to the leasing companies. As at 31 December 2013, the Group’s maximum exposure to such guarantees was RMB2,526 million. The term of these guarantees coincides with the tenure of the lease contracts which generally range from 2 to 5 years. For the year ended 31 December 2013, there was no payment made for repossession of machinery incurred under the guarantee arrangement as a result of customer default. The table below sets forth the details of our current assets and liabilities as of 31 December 2013: (million) Our net current assets increased from RMB29,134 million as at 31 December 2012 to RMB32,223 million as at 31 December 2013 primarily attributable to the increase of trade and other receivables. Our outstanding short-term loans and other borrowings, including long-term bank and other borrowings due within one year, reduced by 12.89% from RMB9,639 million as at 31 December 2012 to RMB8,397 million as at 31 December 2013 primarily attributable to the decrease in long-term borrowings due within one year. The following table sets forth our short-term and long-term bank and other borrowings as of 31 December 2013: (million) As at 31 December 2013, our US dollar unsecured short-term and long-term loans with aggregate outstanding principal amounts of RMB2,134 million and RMB3,097 million, respectively, were subject to certain restrictive ﬁ nancial covenants. As of 31 December 2013, we did not breach any of these restrictive ﬁ nancial covenants. If we were unable to comply with such restrictive ﬁ nancial covenants and were not exempted by the lending banks, we might be ordered to repay the bank loans immediately, and our liquidity will be adversely affected. The Company regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to maintain a balance between the higher shareholder returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and makes adjustments to the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions. The Company monitors its capital structure on the basis of adjusted debt-to-equity ratio. As of 31 December 2013, our adjusted debt-to-equity ratio was 49% (2012: 47%). Please refer to note 27 of the ﬁ nancial statements prepared under IFRSs for the calculation basis of such ratio. As at 31 December 2013, our credit facilities from 35 domestic and overseas ﬁ nancial institutions amounted to approximately RMB78,100 million have not been utilized. In addition, 8 domestic ﬁ nancial institutions have granted facilities in an aggregate amount of RMB26,000 million to us under non-recourse factoring arrangements. Exposure to liquidity risk arises in the normal course of the Company’s business. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Company’s policy is to regularly monitor its liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure that it maintains sufﬁ cient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major ﬁ nancial institutions to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and long term. The following table sets out the remaining contractual maturities of the ﬁ nancial liabilities as of 31 December 2013, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash ﬂ ows (including interest payments computed using contractual rates or, if ﬂ oating, based on current prevailing rates as of 31 December 2013) and the earliest date the Company would be required to repay: As of 31 December 2013 RMB (in millions) As of 31 December 2012 RMB (in millions) The Company’s directors conﬁ rmed that the current cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash ﬂ ow from operations and undrawn committed credit facilities will be sufﬁ cient to meet the anticipated cash needs, including its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months following the balance sheet date. Credit risk is primarily attributable to bank deposits, trade and other receivables, receivables under ﬁ nance lease, ﬁ nancial guarantees and endorsed bills with full recourse which were derecognized by the Group. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of these ﬁ nancial assets and guarantee obligations. In respect of trade and other receivables, individual credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. Collaterals, such as properties, machinery or third party guarantees, are generally required for customers with lower credit ratings. In addition, credit insurance coverage is required for overseas sales. Certain customers are required to pay by letters of credit. Debtors overdue by three months or more are handled by risk management department which is responsible for recovering debts through legal and other actions. In respect of receivables under ﬁ nance lease, a risk control committee is responsible for the establishment of credit risk management policies, the supervision on the implementation of such policies and determination of the key terms of the lease contracts. Credit review department, legal department, ﬁ nance department and information technology department are collectively responsible for credit risk management and monitoring of settlement of receivables under ﬁ nance lease. Bank deposits are placed with ﬁ nancial institutions that have high credit ratings. Given their credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. Please refer to notes 17, 18 and 28 of the ﬁ nancial statements prepared under IFRSs for more quantitative information about the Company’s credit risk. Interest rate risk exposure arises primarily from bank deposits, receivables under ﬁ nance lease, short-term and long-term bank and other borrowings. These ﬁ nancial instruments bearing interest at variable rates and at ﬁ xed rates expose us to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk, respectively. Please refer to note 28 of the ﬁ nancial statements prepared under IFRSs for more quantitative information about the Company’s interest rate risk. The Company is exposed to currency risk primarily through deposits, sales, purchases and borrowings which give rise to receivables, payables, loans and borrowings and cash balances that are denominated in a foreign currency, that is, a currency other than the functional currency of the operations to which the transactions relate. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, HK dollars, Japanese Yen and Euro. Please refer to note 28 of the ﬁ nancial statements prepared under IFRSs for more quantitative information about the Company’s currency risk.

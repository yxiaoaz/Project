There are both high-end residential and well-located projects for the growing middle-class in both Shanghai and Chongqing. Luxurious design and leading residential projects, characterized by themes and motifs, are connected with mass transit system with rapid, convenient and efficient transportation. These are modern, well-designed architectural projects situated at prime retail areas in major cities in the PRC which combines retail, residential, entertainment, cultural and recreational users with great accessibility, a focal point with attractions for residential, investment and business operations. China’s economic growth was stable towards the end of 2013. The GDP growth for 2013 was 7.7% as compared to 7.8% in 2012. Residential property prices in China grew at rather sharp rate in 2013. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, new-home prices grew 20% in Guangzhou and Shenzhen in 2013 and 18% in Shanghai and 16% in Beijing for the same period. Even with imposed nationwide measure by the government to cool the market in March, major cities had also imposed additional measures, such as raised minimum down payments for second homes in November to slow down the price growth rate further. Initial statistics in December 2013 saw a slight easing of price growth rate, resulting from the effect of the additional policies. By the end of 2013, the total retail sales of China grew 13.1% to RMB23.44 trillion, with urban consumption up by 12.9% and rural residents spending up by 14.6% in 2013. Demand for retail space in most cities remains strong with key cities in prime areas registered steady rental growth rate. Global F&B and fashion retailers continue to increase their presence in China by taking up more stores in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The main theme for the office market in China was dominated by strong supply situation, with over 1.7 million square metres of new completion in 2013. A large portion is located in Western China of Chongqing and Chengdu and in North China. Those two regions saw rental rates weakened for 2013. In Eastern China, other than Shanghai, rental rates held steady or slightly increased for selected Tier 2 cities as demand remained strong. The Shenzhen market saw an increase in vacancy rate and rental rate decline due to the diminishing impact of preferential policies and the peak period of small- to medium-sized leases expiry. Main drivers for demand are from finance, real estates, and energy and resources companies. With domestic financial institutions were increasingly active in both office leasing and sales market. Total GDP of Shanghai grew by 7.7% year-on-year to RMB216.02 billion by the end of 2013, as compared to RMB201.0 billion in 2012. Following the announcement of the “Five New Measures” in March, in the second quarter of 2013, Shanghai’s private residential sales volume dropped slightly yet price continued to move up with more first-time home buyers and buyers who wanted to upgrade their premises supported the market during the quarter. This trend continued in the third quarter with developers and home sellers’ reluctance to offer discounts and price cut due to strong market sentiment. As the home prices continued to escalate, the local government introduced the “Seven Articles” in November which targeted second home mortgages and raised the requirements of non-local home buyers. However, the introduction of this policy had limited impact on the residential property market with both price and sales volume continued to rise in the fourth quarter. Demand for Shanghai prime retail properties continued to remain strong as several luxury and high-end brands as well as new brands continued their expansion. Although there had been a significant amount of new supply, strong demand had continued to drive overall vacancy rate down at Shanghai’s mid to high-end shopping centre during the year. Due to high rents in the mid-to high-end shopping malls, there had been a demand for retailers to move their shop space to street-front retail space. Rental rates remained flat in the first and second quarter of 2013, with the drop in third quarter and increase in fourth quarter, the rental level remained static for the whole year. The average rents of Grade A office in the Shanghai CBDs remain static in the first and second quarters of 2013 due to the entering of recent completed projects and the anticipation of future newly completed offices. Rental rose slightly in the third quarter with Pudong area registered an increase faster than Puxi area. The average Grade A office rent in the CBD area leveled off to flat in the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. This was due to the cautious sentiment from the landlord, in view of the upcoming supply and competition from the other decentralized business districts. Chongqing’s real GDP grew by 12.3% year-on-year to RMB1,265.67 billion by the end of 2013 as compared to RMB1,145.90 billion in 2012. Chongqing’s residential property market showed a mild growth in the number of sale transactions recorded in the 4th quarter of 2013 as compared to the 3rd quarter of 2013, the average price of apartments transacted was increased marginally by 1% in the 4th quarter of 2013 to approximately RMB7,155. In view of this, the residential property market is expected to grow at a steady pace. Prime retail rents continued to increase slightly by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the 4th quarter 2013. The average vacancy rate fell to 4.6% whereas prime retail vacancy rate fell to 5.7%. New supply during the 4th quarter of 2013 includes Ruifu Outlets in Jiefangbei CBD area, while emerging areas new supply include Sunshineway Mall in Ba’nan District and Yingli International Plaza in Yuzhong District. Although with the new supply, Paradise Walk (West) and CapitaMall Jiulongpo were almost fully occupied. The office property market growth was moderate by end of 2013, despite the new supply driving up vacancy rate. Average Grade A office rents rose slightly to 2.7% quarter-on-quarter in the 4th quarter of 2013 due to companies’ expansions and relocations. City-wide Grade A vacancy rate rose to 34.6% quarter-on-quarter in the 4th quarter of 2013, whereas in non-prime regions such as Nan’an District, vacancy rate fell by 33.6%. The latter decrease in vacancy rate was supported by small and medium companies in the trade, finance and services industries. Demand for office space located in the prime areas such as Jiefangbei CBD and Jiangbeizui CBD is expected to remain stagnant with new round of supply expecting to enter into the market in 2014. After the announcement of The “Five New Measures” launched in the 1st quarter of 2013 and the “Seven Articles” launched in November, local governments will still continue to address the rising home prices in 2014, in particular to curb the pre-sales of high-end residential projects and increase in land for low- to mid-end projects. However, the sustained strong demand and limited supply of land in Tier 1 cities is likely to put upward pressure on cities like Beijing and Shanghai. In contrast, price growth will become more moderate in Tier 2 and 3 cities due to abundant supply. In the retail market, performance of shopping malls between landlords will be uneven with some malls in core city areas may perform better and in high demand from international brands yet some landlords may require to do a complete overhaul in retail concept in order to compete in this challenging and overcrowded market. New supply of retail spaces is expected to remain high in 2014, most of it coming from Tier 2 cities. More cases of operation failure and repositioning are expected, while increasing pressure on rental performance will continue. It is anticipated that office space downsizing or decentralization in the traditional manufacturing sectors will be impacted after the China’s Central Economic Work Conference had put a focus on economic restructuring. Shanghai and Shenzhen are expected to see substantial new supply in the Tier 1 cities whereas Tier 2 cities such as Chengdu are expected to see another peak in 2014. However, with the constant urbanization and the promotion of growth industries by the government, it is anticipated that overall office market will remain positive in the long run in Shanghai whereas Tier 2 cities where most of the supply would come from are likely to face tougher competition. The Group’s profit attributable to equity holders for the year amounted to HK$1,132 million (2012: HK$1,757 million), decreased by 35.6% when compared to 2012.

Basic earnings per share were HK$0.63 (2012: HK$0.97), a decrease of 35.1%, largely in line with the drop in rate of investment property appreciation by 49.7%. As at December 31, 2013, the total assets increased to HK$64,712 million from HK$60,683 million in last year, as the Group continues its investment in premium property developments with attendant appreciation in fair values, albeit at a rate lower than last year. Net assets, the equivalent of shareholders’ funds, similarly continued to grow to HK$42,732 million (December 31, 2012: HK$40,310 million), reflecting the solid investment value to shareholders. In terms of value per share, net assets value per share is HK$23.62 at the end of the reporting period, as compared to HK$22.28 as at December 31, 2012. The Group’s revenue of HK$1,045 million (2012: HK$693 million) increased by 50.8% when compared with last year, and was mainly due to the increase in revenue from sales of development properties. The revenue from sales of development properties amounted to HK$1,031 million (2012: HK$674 million), increased by 53.0% as compared to 2012. The Group sold with a gross floor area (“GFA”) of approximately 2,071,000 sq. ft. in 2013 (2012: 1.439.000 sq. ft), a 43.9% increase as compared with last year. Gross profit margin for sales of development properties was 42.9% (2012: 38.1%). The increase was due to current year’s sale of 2,071,000 sq. ft. of Chongqing Manhattan City Phase I and Phase II while in 2012, sales were mainly generated from Chongqing Manhattan City Phase I, which had a lower gross profit margin than that of Chongqing Manhattan City Phase II. Income from property leasing decreased by 56.3% to HK$7 million (2012: HK$16 million). The decrease was attributable to the termination of certain tenancies for the future upgrade construction of the mall development. Property management income was HK$8 million (2012: HK$3 million). During the year, the Group generated income of HK$73 million and HK$958 million from sales of residential properties of Chongqing Manhattan City Phase I and Phase II respectively. Deposits received on sales of properties decreased to HK$281 million as at December 31, 2013 from HK$1,147 million as at December 31, 2012 due to the release of deposits to revenue upon delivery of Chongqing Manhattan City Phase I and II. Other income and gains were HK$78 million (2012: HK$54 million), a rise of 44.4%. It mainly comprised gain from disposal of investment properties of HK$42 million (2012: HK$36 million), net exchange gain of HK$26 million (2012: HK$11 million) and interest from bank deposits of HK$9 million (2012: HK$3 million). During the year, selling expenses were HK$42 million (2012: HK$34 million), increased by 23.5%. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses was generally in line with the increase in revenue of the Group. Administrative expenses during the year were HK$127 million (2012: HK$99 million) which increased by 28.3% when compared to 2012. The increase was mainly attributed to the increase in compensation paid to purchasers to re- schedule delivery of properties during the year. Finance costs represent mainly interest expenses and other borrowing costs in relation to bank and other borrowings, effective interest of convertible note, deemed interest of shareholder loan and the fixed rate senior notes (the “Note”) issued in April 2007 and October 2013. Since all finance costs equivalent to HK$782 million (2012: HK$396 million) were wholly capitalized on various projects, finance costs charged to the profit or loss were nil (2012: Nil). The changes in fair value of investment properties were HK$1,052 million (2012: HK$2,090 million), a drop of 49.7%. Although the transaction volume of the property market was shrinking with the launch of new real estate tightening measures in recent years, the property price remained steady during the year because the underlying demand remained strong. On the other hand, the central government’s blueprint that advocates Shanghai to become an international financial hub in 2020 also benefited local businesses including the retail and office property markets. Combining these factors, the valuation of investment properties in 2013 is still appreciating but at slower pace as compared to last year. The changes in fair value of investment properties in Shanghai experienced an increase of HK$913 million (2012: HK$1,781 million). Economic performance in Chongqing, which enjoys one of the highest GDP growth cities in the PRC, was also robust. The changes in fair value of investment properties in Chongqing experienced an increase of HK$139 million (2012: HK$309 million). Income tax expense was HK$337 million (2012: HK$542 million), a decrease of 37.8%. The Group’s effective income tax rate was 22.9% (2012: 23.6%).

In addition, the Group has already made or in the process of making counter-claims for compensation from the construction contractors for causing delay in delivering of the properties to the end customers of the Group. The net financial effect of both claims and counter-claims is considered insignificant. Based on the advices from the independent legal advisors, those outstanding legal claims that are still in preliminary stage and hence the final outcome is unable to be determined at this stage.

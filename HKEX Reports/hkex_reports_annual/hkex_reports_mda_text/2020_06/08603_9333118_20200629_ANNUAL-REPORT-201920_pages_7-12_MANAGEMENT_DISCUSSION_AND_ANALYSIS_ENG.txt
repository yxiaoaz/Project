The Group is a medical aesthetic service provider in Hong Kong and operates five medical aesthetic centres in prime locations of Causeway Bay (the “CWB Centre” and the “CWB Centre 2”), Tsim Sha Tsui (the “TST Centre” and the “TST Centre 2”) and Central (the “Central Centre”) providing non-surgical medical aesthetic services. We strive to provide holistic treatment solutions to our clients through our non-surgical medical aesthetic services, traditional beauty services and sale of skincare products to help our clients maintain and enhance their skin conditions and physical appearance. Our non-surgical medical aesthetic services can generally be categorised as (i) energy-based procedures; and (ii) minimally invasive procedures. The outlook of the medical aesthetic services industry remains optimistic with market demand growing fast in recent years, owed mainly to the increasing affordability and public acceptance of related services. In order to seize the opportunity created by increasing customer demands, we have expanded our operation scale by opening our Central Centre, CWB Centre 2 and TST Centre 2 in May 2019, June 2019 and January 2020 respectively to facilitate the continuous growth of our business. The Group believes that the expansion will enable us to deepen our market penetration in Hong Kong and improve our Group’s profitability. The Group will also take advantage of its enlarging geographical presence to attract new and more diverse customers. Along with the strategic expansion of its medical aesthetic centre network, the Group will sharpen its competitive advantage by extending the spectrum of our treatment services offered. However, for the year ended 31 March 2020, the business environment in Hong Kong was adversely affected by the continuous social incidents and the outbreak of COVID-19, the Group’s revenue amounted to approximately HK$90.4 million, representing a decrease of approximately HK$11.0 million or 10.9% as compared with the corresponding period of 2019. Loss for the year amounted to approximately HK$31.9 million, while loss for the corresponding period amounted to approximately HK$0.2 million. The Directors are of the view that the net loss is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and the increase in operating costs including staff costs, rental expenses, marketing and promotion expenses for the Group’s business expansion. Despite the outlook of medical aesthetic services remains positive, the social instability since June 2019 and the outbreak of COVID-19 since early 2020 weakened clients’ desire and willingness to undergo medical aesthetic treatments which adversely affected the revenue of the Group. The Group will closely monitor the market conditions and will intensify its response and elaborate sustainable development strategies to overcome the current unfavourable environment. Nevertheless, the Group is confident of its capability to deliver quality service to our clients. Moving forward, the Group will apply its strengths, build on its solid customer base and established reputation to deliver stable business development and maximise the shareholders’ value.

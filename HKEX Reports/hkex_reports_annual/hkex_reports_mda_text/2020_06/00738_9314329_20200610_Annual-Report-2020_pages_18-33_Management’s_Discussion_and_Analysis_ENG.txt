Operating Results (Continued) RMB (million) (19.0%) (19.9%) (0.7 percentage point) Consolidated loss attributable (30.5) (28.0) Final dividend (HK cents) Final special dividend (HK cents) During the financial year 2019/20, under the impact of the Sino-US trade conflicts, consumer sentiment in mainland China was dampened, and coupled with the outbreak of novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) during the fourth quarter, the Group’s total sales and same- store sales both recorded negative year-on-year growth. Due to the drop in sales and the increased provision for slow moving inventory, the Group recorded a gross profit of RMB456,500,000 (2018/19: RMB570,200,000), representing a year-on-year decline of 19.9% and the gross profit margin decreased to 62.0%, representing a decrease of 0.7 percentage point as compared to last year. In response to the drop in sales, the Group took extra efforts in controlling the selling and distribution expenses to cut it by 23.3% year-on-year to RMB335,200,000 (2018/19: RMB436,700,000). The ratio of selling and distribution expenses to total revenue thus improved by 2.6 percentage points to 45.5% (2018/19: 48.1%). Profitability Analysis (continued) General and administrative expenses were cut by 4.8% to RMB153,200,000 (2018/19: RMB161,000,000) as compared to last year. During the year, the Group continued to adopt suitable measures to control the relevant cost items, though most of them are fixed in nature. On the other hand, the impairment loss on assets also increased for the year under review. As a result, this cost item as a percentage of total revenue still increased by 3.1 percentage points to 20.8% (2018/19: 17.7%). Other income decreased by 50.2% year-on-year to RMB7,600,000 (2018/19: RMB15,200,000). This item was mainly represented by the incentives from local government. Other losses and gains recorded a net loss of RMB1,600,000 (2018/19: net loss of RMB7,200,000). The year-on-year improvement was mainly due to fair value losses on investment properties of RMB6,900,000 was booked in last year. Profitability Analysis (continued) Consolidated loss attributable to owners of the Company was RMB30,500,000 (2018/19: loss of RMB28,000,000). Basic losses per share was RMB4.32 cents (2018/19: losses of RMB3.97 cents). After reviewing the Group’s existing liquidity position and its future financial needs, the Board did not recommend to declare a final dividend (2018/19: no final dividend per ordinary share and final special dividend of HK35.0 cents per ordinary share). During the year under review, income tax expenses amounted to approximately RMB9,000,000 (2018/19: RMB13,900,000), representing a decrease of 34.9% year- on-year. All business entities of the Group in China are subject to an income tax rate of 25%, while the profit tax rate for corporations in Hong Kong remains at 16.5%. Pursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of China, a withholding income tax of 5% to 10% shall be levied on the dividends remitted by a Chinese subsidiary to its foreign parent company starting from 1 January 2008. As at 29 February 2020, the Group’s inventory balance was RMB273,100,000, representing a decrease of 16.1% as compared to last year. A breakdown of inventory balance was as follows: As at 29 February As at 28 February Changes in Changes in RMB (million) (12.5) (54.8%) (39.8) (13.2%) (52.3) (16.1%) Inventory Management (continued) Following the change in operation scale, the inventory of raw materials and work-in-progress decreased by 54.8% year-on-year. On the other hand, the inventory of finished goods decreased by 13.2% year-on-year and the items of current season and next season (both have stock age less than 1 year) accounted for 63.6% of this ending inventory (28 February 2019: 78.0%). This reflected the Group had timely reduced the ordering of new products to mitigate inventory pressure in response to market changes. Since the decline in sales outweighed the change in inventory, the inventory turnover days of finished goods increased by 43 days to 369 days (28 February 2019: 326 days). The Group’s financial position remained very strong and healthy. As at 29 February 2020, the Group’s cash and bank balances amounted to RMB508,600,000 (28 February 2019: RMB590,600,000), representing a decrease of 13.9% year-on-year. The quick ratio was 5.4 times (28 February 2019: 5.9 times). During the year, the Group had not borrowed any bank loan (2018/2019: Nil) and had no outstanding bank loan as at the fiscal year- end date (28 February 2019: Nil). Forward contracts will be used, if necessary, to hedge related debts and bank borrowings arising from overseas purchases. The Group did not enter into any forward contracts to hedge its foreign exchange risks during the year. In addition, working capital requirements for our business operations in Mainland China will be financed by RMB loans advanced from local banks when necessary. During the financial year ended 29 February 2020, the Group’s cash and bank balances were held in Hong Kong dollars, US dollars and RMB respectively and were deposited in leading banks with maturity of less than one year. With the Group’s steady cash inflow from its operations, coupled with its existing cash and banking facilities, it has adequate financial resources to fund its future needs. In 2019, the global economy was full of uncertainties. The Sino-US trade war, which lasted for more than a year and a half, had an impact on the economies of both countries. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the PRC grew by 6.1% in 2019, which was the lowest growth rate since 1990. Total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 8.0%, representing a decrease of 1.0 percentage point as compared to the corresponding period of last year, indicating that the growth of retail sales has slowed down in view of the economic conditions. During the year under review, the Group’s retail revenue, as compared to last year, decreased by 19.0% to RMB736,400,000 (2018/19: RMB908,800,000). In January 2020, the PRC and the United States finally signed the first-phase trade agreement and the economic development was expected to improve gradually. While the good news was being taken into account by the market, the outbreak of the COVID-19 spread rapidly all over the world, causing a public health crisis as it evolved into a global pandemic. Economic and financial experts generally predicted that the impact of the pandemic on the PRC’s and global economy would be far more severe than that of SARS in 2003. Faced with negative economic factors and challenges from the pandemic, sales of physical stores were under great downward pressure. The Group responded by taking various measures. As the lockdown decree prevented people from going out, the Group accelerated the development of e-commerce business in order to tap new customer group and to shift existing offline customers to online purchase. To achieve better controls on inventory and operating costs, the Group decided to cease the footwear production in Shunde factory, the Group’s only production base, since May 2020 (for details, please refer to note 35 Events Occurring After the Reporting Date). The Group will replace its footwear production completely with external purchases while such adjustments will also enable our team to focus on product development and design. Last but not least, the Group will continue to employ information technology to enhance operating efficiency. Mainland China is the key market of the Group’s retail business. At the end of the year under review, the Group had a retail network comprised of 441 stores in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, representing a net reduction of 85 stores compared to the corresponding date of last year. The number of self-owned stores dropped by 74, while the number of franchised stores decreased by 11 during the year. As at 29 February 2020, there were 331 core brand le saunda stores, representing a net decrease of 60 stores as compared to the end of last year. There were 52 LINEA ROSA stores, the Group’s high-end fashionable brand, representing a net decrease of 15 stores as compared to the end of last year. As at 29 February 2020, the breakdown of the Group’s retail network was as follows: Self-owned (Year-on-year change) Franchise (Year-on-year change) Total (Year-on-year change) Northern, Northeastern & Retail Network (Continued) Total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 8.0% in 2019, which was the lowest figure since the Asian financial crisis in 1999 (6.8%). However, domestic consumption has become the principal driving force for economic growth for 6 consecutive years, contributing 57.8% to the ultimate economic growth. Consumption upgrade was the main growth engine of the domestic retail sector, driving the continuous optimization of market consumption structure, the continuous promotion of industry transformation and upgrade, and the accelerated formation of new consumption hotspots. This has resulted in a significant increase in the demand for categories related to upgraded consumption, while the growth of staple products has been stable. Up to the end of the third quarter of this financial year, the total sales and same-store sales of the Group’s self- owned retail business continued to improve year on year, reflecting that the strategies of streamlining network of physical stores and structural optimization in the past two to three years have gradually yielded results. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 severely hit the consumer market in January and February 2020. As a result, the Group’s retail sales in Mainland China in the year under review fell by 17.1% to RMB705,600,000 (2018/19: RMB850,900,000). Retail Network (Continued) Mainland China (Continued) After analyzing the changes in the business environment throughout the year, we are of the view that the following key factors affected our results in the year under review: (i) the Group continued to optimize its physical stores network and operating structure to improve its operating efficiency, which greatly reduced the proportion of inefficient stores and led to an increase in the same-store sales before the outbreak of the epidemic; (ii) the varied results of promoting experiential shopping and digital transformation in department stores: some stores have encountered bottlenecks while others have successfully completed the transition. At the same time, the number of completion of new shopping malls has decreased. For traditional retail brands, especially those with a high proportion of concessionary counters, they have to spend a lot of resources striving to catch up with the changes of all these new business and operating models; (iii) online purchase continued to grow rapidly with a growth rate higher than that of the overall retail sales of consumer goods and absorbed the market share of physical stores; and (iv) subject to the influences of the external market and the worldwide economy, consumers have become less impulsive and more rational in buying and will demand much more from the retailers. The Group’s operating strategies in the past two to three years has gradually improved our performance. We will endeavor to cut costs to improve our operating efficiency continuously. To enhance the loyalty of our long-term customers, we will use information technology tools to collect and analyze their preferences. Benefiting from the advantages of integrating our online and offline shops, we can target different customer groups with different channels. With all the above adopted, we hope our business will rebound quickly and resume growth after the epidemic subsides. Retail Network (Continued) Hong Kong’s GDP recorded negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 while its annualized GDP for 2019 was forecast to fall by 1.2% in real terms as compared with the previous year, which was the first yearly decline since 2009, representing Hong Kong’s economy has been in recession. During the year under review, social events in Hong Kong continued for months. From June to December 2019, areas in which our stores operate were repeatedly affected by the social events, with business hours shortened, foot traffic dropped sharply, and consumers’ buying desire weakened severely. Visitor arrivals recorded a decline of 39.1% in the second half of the year, while the number of visitors for the year dropped 14.2% on an annual basis. Retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 was forecast to fall by 24.1%, the largest quarterly decline on record. Total sales value of the retail sector for the year was forecast to fall by 11.1% as compared with that of 2018. The data reflected that the impact of local social events on consumption and tourism-related industries was serious. While the market was expecting the consumption would be stimulated during the traditional peak season of the Chinese New Year, there came the threat of the COVID-19 epidemic, worsening the already gloomy local market and pushing Hong Kong’s retail industry into a “super- cold winter”. Hit by the local social events, the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia and the external economic uncertainties, the Group’s sales in Hong Kong and Macau decreased by 46.8% to RMB30,800,000 (2018/19: RMB57,800,000) during the year under review. As at 29 February 2020, the number of stores in Hong Kong and Macau was 6, representing a net decrease by 5. As the shop rental in the market has not dropped accordingly, the Group will further reduce the number of physical stores as appropriate, and concentrate to improve the service and operating efficiency of those potential stores and to accelerate the development of local online business. Cristiano Burani Cristiano Burani Blumarine Jeans Versace、La Perla Retail Network (Continued) In 2019, the PRC online retail sales grew by 16.4% to RMB10,632.4 billion, which accounted for 25.8% of the total retail sales of consumer goods, representing a further increase in the share contributed by online retail sales. However, the advantage of large e-commerce platforms, which entered the market the earliest, in securing the e-commerce traffic flow has been weakened and some of their market share has been taken up by various operators of online social media. As a result, large e-commerce operators have shifted to small-towns and rural markets (third- and lower-tier cities) and invested a lot in developing channels to explore the purchasing power of such markets. The millennial generation, who is keen on online purchase, likes to try something new and thus has relatively low brand loyalty. All these greatly increase the cost of attracting customers and selling expenses. The outbreak of COVID-19 has also affected the e-commerce market, imposing great restrictions on logistics and transportation, but to a lesser degree than those on physical stores. During the year under review, e-commerce business revenue decreased by 16.8% year on year. The Group will actively develop e-commerce channels to merge with our offline operation in order to reach out to young customers and gain access to new markets that have not yet been developed. Being a fashion footwear brand, le saunda likes to have changes in various aspects and to incorporate new elements into its shoes for the market. During the year under review, le saunda collaborated with Cristiano Burani, an Italian designer, to introduce the 2020 Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter capsule collection of footwear in Milan in September 2019 and February 2020 respectively. It was the first appearance of le saunda in the prestigious Milan Fashion Week, one of the “Big Four fashion weeks” in the world. The said collaboration collection demonstrates the outfit style in modern workplace. To change the monotonous perception, the collection added a touch of casualness in formal footwear. Designer Cristiano Burani was formerly the design director of Blumarine Jeans, and is currently the creative director of Takisada Group in Japan. He also worked for luxury brands such as Versace and La Perla before. Brand Building (Continued) During the year under review, the Group also held the 2019 Fall/Winter and 2020 Spring/Summer Media Preview Day for le saunda and LINEA ROSA at two top- class hotels, namely the Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong and Hotel Éclat Beijing. In the events, the Group invited a number of major media publishers, senior fashion editors, celebrity stylists and fashion KOLs to preview the products of the two brands in the new season. LINEA ROSA further held the 2019 Fall/Winter Media Preview Day and opened a new showroom in the prosperous Via Filippo Turati in Milan, which attracted a number of foreign media and fashion stylists. In addition, the Group passed the assessment in the “Quality Tourism Services” certification scheme implemented by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and was recognized as a certified retailer. The products and services of participating retailers were assessed by three main criteria, namely “transparent price; clear product information; and superb customer service”, to attain the certification of the scheme and the recognition proves to be trustworthy for consumers. Moreover, the Group was named again as one of the “2019 Top 100 E-commerce Enterprises in Guangdong Province”. The annual assessment of “Top 100 E-commerce Enterprises in Guangdong Province” aims to acknowledge e-commerce enterprises with considerable amount of assets, huge social influence, promising development potential and a strong sense of social responsibility. Apart from organizing marketing and promotion functions as well as participating in award-winning activities, the Group also fulfilled its corporate social responsibilities through collaboration with social service organizations to, among others, take part in charitable activities and environmental protection initiatives, offer youth internship programs and participate in youth training projects. During the year under review, the Group was honour to be awarded the “10 Years Plus Caring Company Logo” and the “Happy Company” award again. In future, the Group will continue to strive for better results while proactively participate in community affairs to contribute to the society. At the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 materially impacted consumer sentiment. To meet the consumption demands accumulated during the outbreak, the Group will make use of the advantage of “contactless” transaction of e-commerce, expedite the development of e-commerce, proactively foster the exchange of traffic between online and offline channels and prepare to introduce new experiential shopping services in our physical stores to satisfy the demands accumulated during the outbreak, thereby improving our sales performance. Meanwhile, the uncertainty in the global economy and market still casts a shadow over the consumer markets in Hong Kong and the PRC. The Group will adopt a prudent and pragmatic approach that there has no expansion plan to open new stores in the short run. Instead, we will reduce the number of stores in certain regions and continue to reduce cost to increase our operational efficiency. E-commerce business continues to play a key role in the Group’s development. The new retail trend has entered the stage of stable development. A number of new competitors entered the e-commerce market while some e-commerce operators also opened offline physical stores. The e-commerce market has changed from the orientation of increasing traffic flow to meeting customer demand. To distinguish from numerous operators in the market, it is necessary to meet the needs and expectations of consumers. The Group will use information technology tools to analyze customers’ buying habits and preferences, and explore the potential needs of the market by cooperating with suitable key opinion leaders in promotion. In addition, building relationships with VIPs is another key aspect of work, where we will establish more personalized communication with VIPs and provide them with more caring services. As usual, the Group conducts business with multiple large e-commerce platforms. In the following year, the Group will strengthen the cooperation with e-commerce platforms and develop low-tier markets as new growth engine. In addition to working with e-commerce platforms and social networking e-commerce companies, the Group also actively searches for other partners such as department stores. During the reform of the industry, some department stores succeeded in the transformation to enhance their key operational capacities by introducing experience- based service to attract traffic, as well as implementing digital management in various aspects such as supply chain, marketing, payment and VIPs’ database. With a mutual goal to provide better service for customers, having a strategic partnership with department stores, enable the Group and these department stores to benefit from the competitive edges of each other. In the future, shopping will not only offer physical products, but also provide an inspiring experience which is emotionally satisfying for the customers. Besides, the Group will continue to reduce cost and improve operational efficiency through transition from manufacturing and sales of our own products to relying on purchase wholly from external subcontractors. The Group will concentrate its resources onto product development and design. By strengthening cooperation with overseas Italian designers, we will offer more stylish products to boost the brand awareness in the market. To keep abreast of new digital technology, the Group will implement modern management practice to utilize human resources in a more efficient manner. The Group believes that we will strengthen our core competitive advantages by means of ongoing implementation of the above strategies and measures. We will strive for better results and create stable returns for our Shareholders when the market and economy recover.

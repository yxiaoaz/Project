The Group is principally engaged in the business of construction works and environmental protection. The Group continued to act as a contractor in the Hong Kong construction industry and principally engaged in foundation works, civil engineering works and general building works in Hong Kong. The foundation works of the Group include bored piling, driven H-piling, socketed H-piling, mini-piles, footing foundation and pile cap works. Civil engineering works include site formation (including associated infrastructure works), roads and drainage works and landslip preventive and remedial works to slopes and retaining walls. The Group also acted as main contractor in some building projects, and had also been retained as sub- contractors in projects of alterations and additions, renovation, and fitting-out for existing buildings. Our construction business including foundation works, civil engineering works and general building works fell below our expectations for the Year. This was largely due to a combination of highly competitive pricing resulted from limited tendering projects and unforeseeable difficulties with complicated soil strata in different depth range of various construction projects which undermined the profit margin of the segment significantly. During the Year, the gaining of funding approval through the Legislative Council in Hong Kong was proven to be difficult. The delay in funding approval for public works led to reduction in Government infrastructure projects resulting in significant reduction of tenders. The limited tendering opportunities increased the competition in the construction industry, which affected the tendering price and profit margin of the projects. The management has made a strategic move to balance the project award success with fair profit margins, contributed to the significant decrease in number of new contracts awarded from 18 new contracts for the year ended 31 March 2016 to only 6 new contracts for the Year. Going forward, the Group shall pay more attention to tendering and subcontractor considerations such as fluctuating cost factors and project difficulties associated with challenging foundation or civil engineering content. The shortage of skilled labour and escalating construction costs in Hong Kong remain a concern. To cope with these problems, the management will explore alternative ways to address the above issues. The Group also engaged in trading of construction materials to enhance shareholders’ value. During the Year, the management also sought to take advantage of the trading of construction materials to different construction suppliers and developers to increase the revenue as well as profit contribution to the Group. Despite the fact that, the losses from the two construction works outweighed the net profit from the sales of construction materials during the Year, the management considered that there is a good prospect in sales of construction materials, which could provide positive returns to the Group. The management intends to put more resources to expand its trading business onwards. During the Year, the Group has secured 6 new contracts (2016: 18 new contracts) with an aggregated contract value of approximately HK$549.68 million (2016: approximately HK$964.42 million). Details of the new projects awarded are as follows: Lot No. 541 at So Kwun Wat Road, Area 56, Tuen Construction of large diameter bored piles, socketed steel H-pile, pipe pile, king post, geotechnically instrumentation, drainage, ELS No. 138 Pok Fu Lam Road, Construction of Socketed Steel H-Pile, Soldier Pile, Pipe Pile, Geotechnically Instrumentation, Tung Chung and Texaco Road Tung Chung Area 27 & Construction of large diameter bored piles, mini-pile, pipe pile, king post, sheet pile, geotechnically instrumentation, ELS and pile Sau Ming Road, Sau Mau Construction of Mini-piles and associated So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun, N.T. Area 56A, Kau To, Shatin, Sha Tin Town Lot No. 578, Superstructure contract works for residential As at 31 March 2017, the Group had 12 projects in progress (2016: 20 projects in progress) with an aggregated contract value of approximately HK$1,235.46 million (2016: approximately HK$1,434.96 million). The management considered that all of the projects in progress were on schedule and none of which would cause the Group to indemnify the third parties and increase the contingent liabilities. The details of projects in progress as at 31 March 2017 are as follows: Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, 1 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Construction of Socketed H-Piles, Earthworks TMTL 435, Castle Peak Road — Tai Lam, Area 55, Siu Sau, Tuen Mun, New Tree Felling, Design and Built of Site Formation, ELS, Pipe Pile, Socketed H Piles, United Christian Hospital, 130 Hip Wo Street, Kwun Phase 8, Tung Tau Estate, Construction of Hoarding, Pile Cap, ELS and East Kowloon Cultural Centre East Kowloon Cultural Centre Construction of Socketed H-piles, Geotechnically Instrumentation, Hoarding Southern Part of the Former No. 46–65A Pok Fu Lam Construction of large diameter bored piles, shear pile, pipe pile, geotechnically instrumentation, drainage, ELS and pile cap Lot No. 541 at So Kwun Wat Road, Area 56, Tuen Mun, N.T.

The environmental protection business of the Group commenced in the second half of the year ended 31 March 2016 and generated revenue and profit for the Year. (i) During the Year, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest in Taiyuan Tianrun from Taiyuan Runhe Environmental Protection Engineering Co., Ltd ( ) at a consideration of RMB43,447,500. For details, please refer to the Company’s announcement dated 28 June 2016. Taiyuan Tianrun is principally engaged in the kitchen waste treatment after its commencement of operations.

The vendor also undertakes that the audited net profits after tax and attributable to shareholders of Suzhou Clear Industry (deducting the Exceeded Amount if required and excluding the revenue generated from the investment and contracting by the Group to the kitchen waste treatment project of Suzhou Clear Industry and Clear Industry (Shanghai) and the kitchen waste treatment project of Loudi Fangsheng) for the year ended 31 March 2017 shall be RMB20 million. For the financial year ended 31 March 2017, the Group has consolidated the assets and liabilities and financial results of the Target Group (including its subsidiary Suzhou Clear Industry) since completion of the acquisition of Clear Industry in December 2016. Nonetheless, the Group requires extra time to complete the audited financial statements of Suzhou Clear Industry for the financial year from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. Further information in relation thereto will be released in a separate announcement when such information is available. On 23 January 2017, the Group, Chieng Hsin Machinery (Kunshan) Co., Ltd (“Chieng Hsin”), being the creditor, Fu Li Biotechnology Co., Ltd ( ) (“Fu Li”), being the vendor and Hefei Feifan Bio Technology Co., Ltd* ( ) (“Hefei Feifan”) entered into the acquisition agreement, pursuant to which, the Group has conditionally agreed to acquire 80% equity interest in Hefei Feifan from Fu Li at the consideration of US$2,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$15,515,000). On the same date, the Group, Fu Li, Chieng Hsui and Hefei Feifan also entered into the capital injection agreement, pursuant to which, the Group has conditionally agreed to make the capital injection at an amount of US$10,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$77,576,000) into Hefei Feifan. The acquisition and capital injection agreements were completed on 2 June 2017. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement and the capital injection agreement, Fu Li and Chieng Hsin undertake to the Group that there will be revenue performance upon certain conditions. The Company will comply with the relevant Listing Rules and regulations for disclosing its revenue performance on its next annual report. Further information relating to its performance will be released in a separate announcement while appropriate. Details of which are set out in the Company’s announcement dated 23 January 2017 and 2 June 2017. (ii) The Group acquired the intellectual rights, equipment and inventories of Memsys, which specialised in research and modules production of membrane distillation technology. Non-corrosive plastic structure of Memsys products are applicable to a wide variety of applications in water and industrial area, such as zero-liquid discharge of highly concentrated waste water and alkali waste, and desalination plant projects in different scales. In March 2017, the Group entered into the acquisition agreement with the vendors, pursuant to which the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, conditionally agreed to acquire and the vendors conditionally agreed to sell, the 100% equity interest in the capital of Beijing China Science Resources & Environmental Technology Co., Ltd.* ( ) (“CSRE”) at a consideration of RMB25,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$28,205,000) which will be satisfied (i) as to RMB20,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$22,564,000) in cash; and (ii) as to RMB5,000,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$5,641,000) by the allotment and issue of 1,709,370 consideration new shares by the Company at HK$3.3 per share. Upon completion, CSRE will become an indirect wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company, which is principally engaged in the business of trading, EPC of water treatment and provision for other environmental improvement solutions systems. CSRE not only successfully began the application and commercialisation of Memsys’ membrane distillation technology but also focuses in the research, application and commercialisation of zero-liquid discharge technology. It is one of the few technology providers for brine, acids and alkaline water treatment in the PRC. As such, CSRE can bring Memsys’ technology into the PRC, start widescale commercialisation and open new markets of membrane distillation technology for Memsys globally. The aforesaid acquisition is yet to be completed as at the date of this report. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the vendors undertake to the Group that there will be profit guarantee for the period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 and performance guarantee from date of establishment of CSRE to 30 April 2018. The Company will comply with the relevant Listing Rules and regulations for disclosing its profit and performances guarantee in its next annual report. Details of which are set out in the Company’s announcement dated 2 March 2017. Further information relating to its performance in relation thereto will be released in a separate announcement while appropriate. (i) Acquisition of 49% equity interest in PT. Dempo Sumber Energi (“DSE”) Reference is made to the announcements of the Company dated 23 March 2016, 6 April 2016, 30 May 2016, 21 September 2016 and 24 April 2017 in relation to the acquisition of 49% equity interest in DSE. As at the date of this report, PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero) and the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesia are still under discussion on the execution of MEMR 19/2015 and additional time is required for the fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the acquisition agreement entered into by, among others, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Vendor (as amended and supplemented by the supplemental agreement). The parties entered into an extension deed on 21 September 2016 to extend the long stop date from 23 September 2016 to 21 April 2017 and a second extension deed was entered on 21 April 2017 to further extend the long stop date to 20 October 2017 or such later date as the parties may further agree in writing. The Company will make further announcement for completion of the above acquisition as and when appropriate in accordance with the Listing Rules. (ii) Acquisition of PT. Sumatera Pembangkit Mandiri (“SPM”) In August 2016 the Group also entered into an acquisition agreement in relation to acquisition of 80% equity interest in SPM at a consideration of not exceeding US$4.6 million, depending on the final tariff to be reached in the power purchase agreement. SPM is the project company for the development of a hydropower plant in Indonesia. Such acquisition is yet to be completed as at the date of this report. As all the applicable percentage ratios (as defined under the Listing Rules) in respect of such acquisition are less than 5%, such acquisition is not subject to the notification and announcement requirements pursuant to the Listing Rules. (iii) On 16 August 2016, the Group completed the allotment of 80,000,000 shares (the “Subscription Shares”) at HK$2.10 per share to 2 independent subscribers. The Subscription Shares represented approximately 16.67% of the then issued share capital of 480,000,000 shares as enlarged by the allotment and issue of the Subscription Shares. The gross proceeds and net proceeds from the subscription amounted to approximately HK$168 million and approximately HK$167.1 million (after deduction of the legal fees and other professional expenses) respectively, which is intended to be used for the general working capital for the operation and development of the kitchen waste treatment business of the Group and the possible acquisition of the water treatment business by the Group. As disclosed in the interim results announcement for the six months ended 30 September 2016, the Group entered into a termination agreement in November 2016 in relation to the possible acquisition of certain water treatment plants. As such, the remaining net proceeds will be applied for development of kitchen waste treatment and other business opportunities. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had utilised all the net proceeds from the Subscription Shares for the acquisition and development of the kitchen waste treatment business. A summary of the use of proceeds is set out as follows: (124.9) (42.2) (iv) On 31 March 2017, the Company and the subscriber entered into the principal terms of investment, pursuant to which the Company conditionally agreed to issue, and the subscriber conditionally agreed to subscribe for, the convertible bonds with an aggregate principal amount of not more than US$40,000,000. The conversion shares will be allotted and issued under a specific mandate to be passed at the extraordinary general meeting of the Company (the “EGM”) to be convened. Further announcement on the poll results of the EGM will be made in accordance with the Listing Rules. Details of which are set out in the Company’s announcement dated 31 March 2017. (i) The Group conducted reviews, based on discounted cashflow method, on impairment of goodwill and intangible assets arising mainly from the acquisition of Clear Industry and Taiyuan Tianrun, and no impairment loss has been recognised during the Year. (ii) On 27 February 2017, the Company entered into the warrants subscription agreement with a senior corporate consultant (the “Consultant”) of the Company, pursuant to which, the Company conditionally agreed to issue and the Consultant conditionally agreed to subscribe for 4,000,000 warrants at the issue price of HK$0.33 per warrant. Each warrant carries the right to subscribe for one warrant share at the exercise price of HK$3.33 per warrant share. Subsequent to the entering into of the warrants subscription agreement, the Company and the Consultant had renegotiated certain terms of the warrants subscription agreement, but have yet to reached a conclusion on or before 31 March 2017. As such, the warrants subscription agreement had lapsed and become null and void against the Company and the Consultant as at 31 March 2017. The environmental protection business in the PRC has been growing robustly due to on-going food safety issues and nationwide political support on environmental protection business industry, which provides a solid foundation for such business growth in the PRC. In the “Plan for Establishing Facilities for the Innocuous Treatment of Municipal Solid Waste under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (Draft)”, the National Development and Reform Commission & Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the PRC set the target of the garbage disposal rate of municipalities and provincial capitals at 100% by 2020; encouraged joint treatment of food waste & other organic biodegradable waste in order to achieve a processing capacity of 40,000 tons per day by the end of Thirteenth Five-Year. Given the huge upside potential, a strong but steady growth in the industry is expected in the coming years. During the Year, the Group recorded an increase in revenue and profit from the environmental protection business through the revenue generated from newly-acquired Clear Industry, and construction of BOT kitchen waste projects. Taking into account of the formation of joint venture in Hanzhong as set out in below “Significant Events after the Reporting Period, the Group would be able to secure four kitchen waste treatment sites in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, Loudi of Hunan Province and Hefei of Anhui Province in the PRC with a total planned capacity of 1,150 tons per day. The Group will continue to actively seek for new opportunities for construction and operation for kitchen waste projects through investments, bid-tendering, acquisition as well as providing solution systems and operations of kitchen waste treatment plants. With the increase in awareness of the pollution of kitchen wastes and emphasis on recycling kitchen wastes into useful resources, it enables us to increase our market share in the kitchen waste treatment in the PRC along with the support of favorable policies and economic growth momentum through the development of the PRC’s environmental protection business. On the other hand, on top of decrease in turnover of our construction business, the Group, for the first time, recorded a loss from construction business during the Year. During the year, the Group’s construction business underwent a fierce and competitive business environment as a result of (i) downturn in Hong Kong economy; (ii) slowdown in the number of new development of construction site; and (iii) continuing keen competition in terms of increasing number of competitors and profit margin of the construction projects. As such, the Group continues to implement measures to further strengthen our cost-effectiveness through better design optimisation. During the Year, revenue of the Group decreased by approximately 12.18% to approximately HK$1,239.81 million (2016: HK$1,411.80 million). Gross profit increased by approximately 51.36% to approximately HK$198.96 million (2016: HK$131.45 million). Profit for the Year attributable to owners of the Company decreased by approximately 4.24% to approximately HK$47.61 million (2016: HK$49.72 million). Earnings per share decreased by 16.67% to HK$0.10 (2016: HK$0.12). The construction business of the Group reported a net loss of approximately HK$1.40 million for the Year as compared with an adjusted net profit of approximately HK$54.18 million for the year ended 31 March 2016. The loss was attributable to the significant increase in subcontracting charges for unforeseeable high ground water level in MacDonnell Road building project, the increase in various construction costs of various prolonged projects and the rental of oscillator and crawler crane to encounter the challenge for the movement of newly reclaimed ground and complicated soil strata in different depth range in HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge foundation project, which led to a considerable loss in that project, a rare occurrence in our construction history. Revenue of construction business including foundation works, civil engineering works and general building works for the Year decreased by approximately 52.39% from approximately HK$1,411.80 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to approximately HK$672.13 million for the Year. Such decrease was mainly attributable to the highly competitive bidding in the construction market resulted in the reduction on the aggregate contract sum of the newly awarded projects recognised during the Year. In addition, there was absence of sizeable projects for tendering during the Year, and the Group has secured 6 new construction contracts (2016: 18 new construction contracts) with an aggregate contract value of approximately HK$549.76 million (2016: approximately HK$964.42 million). Such decrease was attributable to the new strategic move to balance the project award success with a fair profit margin, which contributed to the decrease in number of new contracts being awarded. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had 12 projects in progress with an aggregated contract value of approximately HK$1,235.46 million, compared to 20 projects in progress and approximately HK$1,434.96 million respectively as at 31 March 2016. The profit margin of construction business decreased to approximately 6.61% for the Year from approximately 9.31% as compared with that of the same period last year. Such decrease was attributable to the keen competition from the market players for the Year. Most of the industry players bid in open tender with a lower tender premium in order to win the bidding. The competitive bidding reduced the profit margin of the Group for the Year. Revenue of sale of construction materials business was approximately HK$85.91 million for the Year. The Group commenced its trading in construction materials in January 2016 and recognised whole year revenue from the sale of construction materials for the Year. Profit from the sale of construction materials for the Year was approximately HK$4.67 million. The contribution of profit was attributable to the recognition of whole year financial performance from the sale of construction materials for the Year. Revenue from environmental protection business represented the construction of BOT kitchen waste projects and other technical services and sales of machineries. During the Year, the Group recognises the construction revenue of Taiyuan’s and Loudi’s projects with reference to its respective fair value of the construction service delivered and stages of completion. The Group also provided certain consultancy services and design and technical solutions for water and kitchen waste treatment plants. The increase in contribution from BOT projects and service income during the Year as the environmental protection business only commenced its operation in the second half of the year ended 31 March 2016 and also no revenue was generated in that year. Excluding the income from the sale of construction materials for the year ended 31 March 2016 of approximately HK$5.68 million, other income and net gain of the Group increased from a net gain of approximately HK$3.59 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to a net gain of approximately HK$11.73 million for the Year, mainly due to the increase in service income as well as the waiver of interest from a related company. Administrative expenses of the Group increased from approximately HK$32.50 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to approximately HK$98.50 million for the Year, amounting for approximately 2.30% and 7.94% of the Group’s revenue for the year ended 31 March 2016 and for the Year, respectively. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in staff costs (including directors’ emoluments) and certain operating costs and expenses associated with environmental protection segment which was established in the second half of the year ended 31 March 2016. In particular, the Group recorded an one-off expense of share-based payment of approximately HK$18.94 million upon the grant of share options during the Year. Other operating expenses of the Group decreased by approximately 55.6% from approximately HK$37.96 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to approximately HK$16.85 million for the Year. The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to a drop in other operating expenses as a result of the decrease in maintenance costs of machineries of construction business in the Year. Finance costs of the Group decreased significantly from approximately HK$8.38 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to approximately HK$2.16 million for the Year, primarily due to full repayment of loan and total interest expense from last year and the reduction of hire purchase interest on machinery acquired during the Year. Other loan of approximately HK$165.94 million was granted in March 2017. Interest rates of finance leases ranged from 2.75% to 3.95% for the Year, as compared with 1.18% to 3.95% for the year ended 31 March 2016. Tax charge of the Group increased by approximately 198.11% from approximately HK$12.16 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to approximately HK$ 36.25 million for the Year. The increase was due to the deferred tax arising from the construction of kitchen waste projects, despite the drop in current taxation caused by net loss of our construction segment of approximately HK$1.40 million for the Year as compared with an adjusted net profit of approximately HK$54.18 million for the year ended 31 March 2016. As at 31 March 2017, the total assets of the Group increased by approximately 65.67% to approximately HK$1,430.76 million from approximately HK$863.60 million for the year ended 31 March 2016. The Group also maintained a strong and sound financial position during the Year. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had bank balances and cash of approximately HK$173.11 million (31 March 2016: approximately HK$195.25 million). The total interest-bearing loans comprising finance lease, other loans and bank borrowings of the Group as at 31 March 2017 was approximately HK$211.39 million (31 March 2016: approximately HK$74.35 million), and current ratio for the Year was approximately 0.99 (31 March 2016: approximately 1.06). Interest rates of interest-bearing loans ranged from 2.75% to 6.00% for the Year, as compared with 1.18% to 3.95% for the year ended 31 March 2016. The Group’s borrowings and bank balances are principally denominated in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi (“RMB”) and there may be significant exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The gearing ratio of the Group as at 31 March 2017 was approximately 44.08% (31 March 2016: approximately 35.19%). The increase in gearing ratio was mainly attributable to the increase in equity during the Year. The gearing ratio is calculated as the payables incurred not in the ordinary course of business (excluding loan from a Director and shareholder) divided by total equity attributable to the owners of the Company as at the respective years. As at 31 March 2017, the Group pledged its operating concession and receivable under service concession arrangements of an aggregate amount of approximately HK$330,608,000 (31 March 2016: nil). As at 31 March 2017, the Group pledged bank deposits of approximately HK$12.44 million (31 March 2016: nil) as collateral to secure banking facilities granted to the Group. Certain revenue-generating operations and assets and liabilities of the Group are denominated in RMB and EURO and may expose the Group to the fluctuation of Hong Kong dollars against RMB and EURO. The Group did not enter into any hedging arrangement or derivative products. However, the Board and management will continue to monitor the foreign currency exchange exposure and will consider adopting certain hedging measures against the currency risk when necessary. Save as disclosed above for the allotment and issue of 80,000,000 new shares to two independent subscribers, there had been no other changes in capital structure of the Company during the Year. The capital of the Company comprises ordinary shares and capital reserves. The Group finances its working capital requirements through a combination of funds generated from operations, bank borrowings and fund raising exercise during the Year. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had capital commitments of approximately HK$112,399,000 (31 March 2016: nil). As at 31 March 2017, the Group had 334 employees (31 March 2016: 273 employees), including the Directors. Total staff costs (including Directors’ emoluments and expense of share-based payments) were approximately HK$148.16 million for the Year as compared to approximately HK$97.56 million for the year ended 31 March 2016. Remuneration is determined with reference to market norms and individual employees’ performance, qualification and experience. On top of basic salaries, bonuses may be paid by reference to the Group’s performance as well as individual’s performance. Other staff benefits include provision of retirement benefit and injury insurance. As at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Group held approximately 5.89% of the total issued share capital of Josab International AB, the shares of which are listed on AktieTorget, a stock exchange in Sweden. Save as disclosed above and except for investment in subsidiaries, during the Year, the Group did not hold any significant investment in equity interest in any other company. Save as disclosed above, the Group did not have any material acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and affiliated companies during the Year. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had an outstanding performance bond for construction contracts amounted to approximately HK$91.50 million (31 March 2016: approximately HK$91.60 million). The performance bond was secured by unlimited corporate guarantees provided by a related company. In addition, the Group was involved in a number of claims arising in the ordinary course of business with insurance coverage during the Year, which will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Group, if materialised. Reference is made to the positive profit alert announcement dated 16 May 2017 (the “Profit Alert Announcement”). As disclosed in the Profit Alert Announcement, the Group expected to record an increase of about 20% in its consolidated profit attributable to equity owners for the Year as compared with that for the year ended 31 March 2016 based on the then available unaudited financial information. As disclosed in the final results announcement of the Company dated 29 June 2017 and this report, the Group recorded consolidated profit attributable to equity owners of HK$47.61 million for the Year, representing a decrease of approximately 4.2% as compared with that for the year ended 31 March 2016. The lower-than-expected consolidated profit recorded for the Year was mainly attributable to (1) the impairment recognised on the debit reserve balance available-for-sale financial assets reserve of approximately HK$7.5 million; and (2) recognition of certain government grant as deferred income of approximately HK$8.2 million that was previously credited to profit or loss. The Board wishes to emphasise that the aforesaid adjustments are non-cash in nature and therefore do not have any substantial adverse impact on the operating cash flows of the Group.

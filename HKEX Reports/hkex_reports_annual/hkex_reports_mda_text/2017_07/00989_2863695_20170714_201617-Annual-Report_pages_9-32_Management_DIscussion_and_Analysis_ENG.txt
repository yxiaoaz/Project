Management On 27 July 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the entire equity interest in Ka Yun Investments Limited (“Ka Yun”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Ka Yun Group”), which is principally engaged in the development, sale and leasing of residential, commercial and tourism properties and the provision of property management services in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) for a consideration of HK$4,650 million (the “Ka Yun Acquisition”). Further details are set out in the section headed “Ka Yun Acquisition” in this “Management Discussion and Analysis”. Ka Yun Acquisition has the aim of bolstering development of the Group’s property business and presenting synergies to its existing businesses and has enabled the Group to hasten property development on the platform it has built, expanding property development and management business in Jilin province to enlarge its market share, so that it may with better advantages capture growth opportunities in the market and expand its businesses at opportune time to other provinces and cities in the PRC. Since changing its name from Ground Properties Company Limited to Ground International Development Limited on 22 September 2016, the Group has been able to implement its business diversification strategy more comprehensively during the year. However, with a view that the call center business within the telecommunications retail sales and management service segment is unlikely to obtain the relevant nationwide permit necessary to participate in the future tender process, on 7 June 2017, the Board resolved to authorise the management of the Group to commence searches for and negotiations with potential purchasers for the disposal of the Group’s interest in members of the Group comprising the telecommunications retail sales and management services business. For the year ended 31 March 2017, overall revenue of the Group was approximately RMB1,225.5 million (2016: RMB624.4 million), representing a year-on-year increase of 96.3%. Gross profit was RMB335.8 million (2016: RMB155.0 million). Net profit after tax was RMB70.8 million (2016: net loss after tax of RMB118.0 million).

The increases in sales by 169.5% and GFA recognised by 114.4% were attributable to the completion and delivery of Guangze • Tudors Palace ( • ) and Guangze Red House ( ) – Phase I during the year ended 31 March 2017 whereas there were no property projects completed during the year ended 31 March 2016. The sale of properties during the year ended 31 March 2016 was related to the sales of the remaining units of the property projects of Guangze • Amethyst City ( • ) and Guangze International Shopping Centre ( ). For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group delivered and recognised sale of car park units of approximately RMB11 million from the sale of 101 car park units (2016: RMB19.5 million from 144 car park units).

Of the Group’s projects under development, the Group’s high-end resort style mixed development project, namely Changbaishan Ground Pine Township International Resort ( ) situated at Guosong Village in Donggang Town ( ), Fusong County ( ), Baishan City is planned to be the Group’s major project in the next few years as the Group focuses on property development that involves cultural tourism ( ). The project will be of a resort style and bear the culture of Northeastern China. In order to complement the residential, commercial, hotel and hostel properties, hot spring centre as well as the natural scenery in the surrounding area of Changbaishan, the resort will include commercial street ( ), various cultural and entertainment facilities. It is intended to offer all visitors with a wide range of activities when visiting Changbaishan Ground Pine Township International Resort ( ).

Subsequent to 31 March 2017, the Group succeeded in a public tender for the acquisition of the land use right of a land parcel in Yanji City, Jilin Province, the PRC, with a total site area of 48,591 sq.m.. BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) Property development (continued) Projects under development and held for development (continued) BUSINESS REVIEW (continued) As at 31 March 2017, the Group held two investment properties, one being office premises and car parks in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong and the other being certain units of a shopping centre in Baishan City, the PRC. Location of Total Kowloon Bay, 40,505 sq.ft. Guangze International Shopping Centre Baishan City, 68,433 sq.m. As at 31 March 2017, the Group leased out all units of Enterprise Square at Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. For the Guangze International Shopping Centre ( ), the Group is currently adjusting the tenant mix at the shopping mall to enhance the traffic flow so as to improve the occupancy rate of the shopping mall. During the reporting year, the Group continued to integrate and optimize its telecommunications retail and management services and the segment brought revenue amounting to RMB193.1 million (2016: RMB202.4 million). Gross profit was RMB60.9 million (2016: RMB61.0 million) and gross profit margin was 31.5% (2016: 30.1%). Net profit after tax was approximately RMB22.1 million (2016: RMB23.1 million). The stable result was mainly attributable to the saturated market of telecommunications industry after substaining fast growth for past years. Given the prevailing conditions of the PRC real estate market and the concept of “all-for-one tourism” being put forward, the cultural tourism, healthcare and elderly care sectors gradually become the trend and direction for new development. To effectively promote its business development, the Group has formulated clear long-term growth strategies and objectives, and identified a growth model of “one primary sector as supplemented by two” ( ) where “one primary sector” refers to cultural tourism and healthcare and elderly care sectors and “two supplementary sectors” refers to the property development and operation management sector and the financial services sector as part of the business adjustment and upgrade transformation. Looking forward, riding on the booming PRC real estate market and the trend of the government’s strong efforts in promoting cultural tourism and healthcare business, the Group will adopt a flexible and diversified business model to generate ongoing and steady revenue and growth from its tourism and related property projects, being landscape tourism focus, developing a south-to-north tourism business belt with “Ground” characteristics. On 31 March 2017, the Group entered into non-legally binding memoranda of understanding with (Changchun Ouya Shenlongwan Tourism Limited Liability Company*, “Shenlongwan Tourism”) and (Jiangxi Shengshuitang Cultural Tourism Development Company Limited*, (“Jiangxi Shengshuitang”) respectively (collectively the “MOUs”), pursuant to which the Group proposed to inject cash of RMB200,000,000 into Shenlongwan Tourism and to establish a joint venture company with Jiangxi Shengshuitang and other possible joint venture partners. As at the date of this annual report, the due diligence work and feasibility studies remain in progress. Details of the MOUs were set out in the Company’s announcements dated 31 March 2017. Upon completion of the acquisition of the entire equity interests in Ka Yun and its subsidiaries on 27 July 2016, the Group has carried out ongoing structural changes to its own businesses, and endeavored its market penetration within the regions in Jilin Province and new market expansion. At the same time, the Group will also integrate and expand the property projects in the first-tier and second-tier cities in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions in China so as to achieve nationwide coverage of property projects and to build its own national brand. The Group successfully acquired the land use rights of a land parcel in Yanji City, Jilin Province (the “Land”) by way of listing-for-sale. The Land has a total site area of approximately 48,591 sq.m. with a plot ratio of approximately 2.25. The Land is mainly used for the development of residential and commercial properties. Other details relating to the Land are set out in the announcement of the Company dated 16 May 2017. PROSPECTS (continued) On the other hand, high emphasis has been placed on privately-owned economy and micro-finance service in Jilin Province over the year of 2017, including innovating financing methods, improving the financing structures, solving micro enterprise high-difficulty high-cost financing problem, and gradually improving the quality of the micro-finance service. In addition, it is expected that micro-finance sector has been announced by the PRC Government to be an area that will help accelerate the development of privately-owned economy. Through the establishment of more micro-finance enterprises, it helps build “supportive” relationship between financial, governmental and privately-owned commercial sectors. In view of the above, the Group is also seeking opportunities to develop and expand into micro-finance sectors to create potential synergies with the Group’s current property development business and to enhance its value to the Group’s shareholders and stakeholders. On 28 March 2017, the Group won the relevant public tender and entered into the public tender equity transfer agreements with the shareholders of (Jilin Zhongye Business Information Advisory Company Limited*) and (Jilin Fengrun Business Information Advisory Company Limited*) (collectively the “Target Companies”). The main asset of the Target Companies is an investment in a subsidiary with principal activity engaged in provision of guarantees in the PRC which is in line with the Group’s development strategies in micro-finance sector. Details of the acquisition were set out in the Company’s announcements dated 9 January 2017 and 28 March 2017 respectively. The acquisition was completed in May 2017 and the total consideration of RMB505.9 million has been settled in cash from the Group’s internal resources and equity financing. As set out in the announcement dated 7 May 2017, given that (Shanghai Motion JUNS Communication Technology Company Limited*), the subsidiary of the Group, is a company ultimately and wholly-owned by foreign invested shareholder, it will not be likely to obtain the nationwide call center business operation permit. Accordingly, in the absence of the nationwide call center business operation permit, the Group will not be eligible to participate in the tender to be conducted by the national telecommunication operator and consequently will have to cease its operation of the call center business in June 2017. The management of the Company has been authorised by the Board on 7 June 2017 to commence searches for and negotiations with potential purchasers for the disposal of the Group’s interests in members of the Group comprising the telecommunications retail sales and management services business (including the call center business) to centralise its resources and efforts in the cultural tourism, healthcare and elderly care, property development and financial services sectors with a view to generating sustainable long-term value to the shareholders. PROSPECTS (continued) Overall speaking, the Group will uphold the strategic development principle of “one primary sector as supplemented by two” ( ). With the cultural tourism and healthcare sector as the core business, the Group will continue to capture the opportunities arising from the development of the property market in Jilin Province. The Group will fully utilise the financial services platform to timely launch quality, innovative and competitive projects to local markets. Seizing the growth opportunities arising from the cultural tourism and healthcare sector and driven by the rising number of tourists locally and abroad as well as local economic growth, the Group will continue to adopt diversified property development strategies and maintain a balanced property portfolio. The Group will promote the brand awareness and recognition of its tourism and property businesses so as to build a solid foundation for sustainable growth in the future. At the same time, the Group will extend and explore high growth potential opportunities on a nationwide scale and expand the scope of tourism, property development and management as well as financial services businesses to other provinces so as to enhance the value of projects and achieve asset diversification. The Group will endeavor to strive for excellence with a view to achieving synchronized development of its three major business segments under the business model of “one primary sector as supplemented by two” ( ). Since the completion of the Ka Yun Acquisition on 27 July 2016, the Group was enlarged by the injection of the property development business held by Ka Yun Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Company had retrospectively accounted for the financial performance and financial position of Ka Yun Group since 24 April 2015 on a merger accounting basis as the Company and Ka Yun are both under the common control of Ms. Cui Xintong (“Ms. Cui”), an Executive Director and the controlling shareholder of the Company. In addition, in view of the above Ka Yun Acquisition, as most of the subsidiaries within the Group operate in the PRC and has a functional currency in Renminbi, the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements have been changed from Hong Kong dollars to Renminbi. The comparatives figures for the previous year have also been changed accordingly. The unaudited net asset values of the Group as at 30 September 2016 and 31 March 2016 should be RMB1,507.4 million and RMB1,040.9 million as compared with those of RMB1,620.8 million and RMB1,154.3 million disclosed in the interim financial report for the six months ended 30 September 2016, respectively. The variance is primarily attributable to the difference in unit development costs on certain projects used for the transfer into costs of properties sold in prior years. During the year, upon completion of the Ka Yun Acquisition, the Group further strengthened its two core businesses, namely property development and management, and property investment. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) Sales of properties became the major source of income for the Group accounting for 81.1% of the Group’s total revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: 61.6%). The analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows: 31 March 2017 31 March 2016 Sales of headphones, mobile phones and Telecommunications retail sales and management The Group’s revenue increased from RMB624.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB1,225.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 or an increase by 96.3%, mainly contributed by the increase in sales of properties by RMB610.1 million. The increase in sales of properties was attributable to the completion and delivery of the Group’s two residential projects, namely Guangze • Tudors Palace ( • ) and Guangze Red House ( ) – Phase I, amounting to RMB848.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2017. The sales of properties recognised of RMB384.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 were mainly related to the sales recognised on the remaining units in respect of Guangze • Amethyst City ( • ) – Phases I and II and Guangze International Shopping Centre ( ). The Group’s overall gross profit has increased from RMB155.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB335.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 and gross margin has increased from 24.8% for the year ended 31 March 2016 to 27.4% for the year ended 31 March 2017 which were mainly attributable to the recognised sales of Guangze • Tudors Palace ( • ) that earned a higher margin. The Group’s other income and gains decreased from RMB30.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB29.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2017. In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group earned RMB27.9 million (2016: RMB15.9 million) from the government subsidy. The government grants in both years were related to the financial subsidies received for the contribution to the development of infrastructure in Baishan City. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) Key changes to income statement items (continued) The decrease in selling and distribution costs by RMB5.6 million from RMB54.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB49.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 was mainly contributed by the decrease in advertisement expenses from fewer advertising activities for the sales of Guangze International Shopping Centre. The decrease in administrative expenses by RMB9.7 million from RMB107.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB97.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 was mainly contributed by (i) the decrease in staff costs of RMB3.8 million from the property development operation that implemented a performance-based salary structure with effect from January 2016; and (ii) repairs and maintenance expenses of RMB3.0 million were incurred for the investment properties in Hong Kong for the year ended 31 March 2016. Other expenses for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016 mainly represented legal and professional fees incurred for the Ka Yun Acquisition. The decrease in finance costs by RMB54.1 million from RMB88.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 to RMB34.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 was mainly attributable to (i) increasing interest expenses that qualified for capitalization and (ii) the decrease in average bank loan balance arising from loan repayment. Derivative financial instruments are the Company’s early redemption rights attaching to the convertible bonds issued in respect of the Ka Yun Acquisition and other fund raising activity (the “Convertible Bonds”). The fair value of the derivative financial instruments were valued by an independent valuer. The change in fair value of the derivative financial instruments was mainly attributable to the change in the Company’s share price at the reporting date when compared with the price at issue dates or the end of last reporting period, whichever is later. The Group’s current income tax includes PRC Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and PRC Land Appreciation Tax (“LAT”). For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group’s income tax amounted to RMB74.7 million, representing an increase in RMB36.1 million or 93.5% when compared to the year ended 31 March 2016. Such increase was mainly attributable to the CIT and LAT provision made in respect of the delivery of units of Guangze • Tudors Palace ( • ) and Guangze Red House ( ) – Phase I upon completion. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) At 31 March 2017, the Group’s investment properties included the office premises in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong and certain units of a shopping mall in Baishan City, Jilin Province. These investment properties were stated at fair value and were valued by Savills Valuation and Professional Services Limited (an independent firm of surveyors). There were no changes in the fair value of these investment properties when compared to that as at 31 March 2016. On 30 December 2016, the Group subscribed for shares in Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Limited (“Jilin Jiutai Bank”). Jilin Jiutai Bank is a joint-stock commercial bank headquartered in Changchun City, Jilin Province, the PRC; and the H-shares of which are listed in the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. As at 31 March 2017, the fair value of the subscribed shares is RMB201.1 million. A positive change in fair value of the investment of RMB24.0 million was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group’s properties under development and completed properties held for sales are located in Jilin Province. The decrease in properties under development and completed properties held for sales from RMB3,131.9 million as at 31 March 2016 to RMB3,118.5 million as at 31 March 2017 was mainly attributable to the transfer of development costs to costs of sales in respect of Guangze • Tudors Palace ( • ) and Guangze Red House ( ) – Phase I upon completion and delivery during the year ended 31 March 2017; and partially offset by the development work on Changbaishan Ground Pine Township International Resort ( ) and Guangze Red House ( ) – Phase II. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) Key changes to financial position (continued) 31 March At 31 March Land development expenditure made by certain subsidiaries of the Group represents monies advanced to the local government for land development works at various land sites. The Directors anticipate that these land sites will be acquired through the tender, auction and listing process which will take place in 2017. At 31 March 2016, amounts due from related companies were related to the property development segment. Upon the completion of the Acquisition, the balances had been settled. Included in other receivables, prepayments and deposits at 31 March 2017 was a prepayment of the consideration for the acquisition of (Jilin Zhongye Business Information Advisory Company Limited*) and (Jilin Fengrun Business Information Advisory Company Limited*) of RMB45 million. FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) As at 31 March 2017, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents of the Group was approximately RMB417.8 million (2016: approximately RMB85.0 million), representing an increase of approximately 391.5% as compared with that as at 31 March 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to certain proceeds from share subscription not yet utilised and a loan from controlling shareholder. The Group’s bank and other borrowings as at 31 March 2017 decreased by RMB21.1 million to RMB967.8 million which was payable as follows: (Restated) Analysed into: Bank loans repayable and trust receipt loan payable: Other borrowings repayable: FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued) Liquidity and financial resources (continued) Debt and gearing (continued) The gearing ratio of the Group is calculated as follows: At 31 March At 31 March (restated) The decrease in the gearing ratio of the Group from 69% at 31 March 2016 to 51% at 31 March 2017 was mainly attributable to the increase in equity during the year via share subscriptions and convertible bonds subscriptions. For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recorded net cash operating inflows of RMB122 million (2016: RMB368 million). The inflow was mainly attributable to an increase in the proceeds from pre-sale of properties after deducting the payments made for continual development of the property projects. For investing activities, the Group recorded a cash outflow of RMB330 million (2016: inflow of RMB297 million). The outflow was mainly contributed by the purchase of available-for-sale investments. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had commitments in respect of properties under development of RMB806.0 million (2016: RMB900.6 million). The development expenditure will be funded by the Group’s internal resources and/or project loans. The Group also had unutilised banking facilities of RMB217.0 million as at 31 March 2017 (2016: RMB209.0 million). The principal risks and uncertainties that may cause the Group’s financial conditions or results materially different from the expected or historical results are described below. The Group’s property projects are located in Jilin Province, the PRC and the related assets accounted for 88.5% of the Group’s total assets as at 31 March 2017. The Group is therefore subject to the risks associated with the PRC property market both nationally and regionally. The Group’s property development and management business in the PRC may also be exposed to the risks of policy change, interest rate change, demand-supply imbalance and the overall economic conditions, which may pose an adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial conditions or results of operations. The Group is looking for projects at other regions in the PRC and overseas in order to diversify the risk. The rental rates and the occupancy rates depend on various factors, including but not limited to, prevailing supply and demand conditions, economic conditions as well as the quality of the properties. There is no assurance that the Group will be able to look for new tenants within a short period of time or procure new leases or renew existing leases at the prevailing market rates. The Group has other exit options to realise the property value if and when considered necessary. As a matter of policy, the Group continues to manage the market risks directly relating to its operations and financing activity and does not undertake any speculative derivative trading activities. All treasury risk management activities are carried out in accordance with the Group’s policies and guidelines, which are reviewed as and when needed. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (continued) As at 31 March 2017, the Group was exposed to currency risk on financial assets and liabilities that were denominated in Hong Kong Dollars (HK$). At 31 March 2017, approximately 41.5% of the Group’s total cash and bank balance (including pledged bank deposit) were denominated in HK$ and approximately 28.9% of the Group’s total borrowings were denominated in HK$, while 71.1% were denominated in RMB. The Group currently does not have a foreign currency hedging policy in respect of foreign current assets and liabilities. The Group will monitor its foreign currency exposure closely and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arises. The Group will continue to monitor the change in the trend of interest rates and the potential causes that trigger large fluctuation in the exchange rates of RMB and HK$, and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure if necessary so as to mitigate the foreign currency exposure arising from the Group’s business operation and to minimize the Group’s financial risks. As at 31 March 2017, 2.6% of the Group’s total bank and other borrowings were interest free, 50.9% bore interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.55% to 6.65% per annum, and 46.5% of the Group’s total borrowings bore interest at floating rates ranging from 3.22% to 8.265%. The Group does not enter into any financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. The Group currently grants an average credit period of 30-60 days to its customers, with certain few customers being offered a period of 90 days. The Group’s debtor turnover days of 70 days (2016: 58 days) remains within the Group’s credit terms. The increase in turnover days was contributed by the increase in service income from a customer who has a longer credit period for the year ended 31 March 2017. A stringent monitoring procedures has put in place to deal with overdue debts and minimize the credit risk of trade receivables. The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants, to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term. On 26 May 2015, Frontier Power Investments Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) (the Purchaser) and Ka Yik (the Vendor) and Ms. Cui (the controlling shareholder, executive director and deputy chairperson of the Company) entered into a sale and purchase agreement (as supplemented by the supplemental agreements dated 3 July 2015 and 22 December 2015 and an extension letter dated 31 March 2016), pursuant to which the Purchaser has agreed to acquire and the Vendor has agreed to sell the entire issued capital of Ka Yun for the consideration of HK$4,650,000,000 which shall be satisfied partly (i) by allotment and issue of new shares by the Company; (ii) by allotment and issue of convertible preference shares by the Company; and (iii) by issue of convertible bonds by the Company. Ka Yun Group is principally engaged in the development, sale and leasing of residential, commercial and tourism properties and property management in the PRC. The Ka Yun Acquisition constitutes a connected transaction, a very substantial acquisition and a reverse takeover under the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Ka Yun Acquisition was approved by the shareholders of the Company on 25 July 2016 and was completed on 27 July Details of the Ka Yun Acquisition were set out in the Company’s announcements dated 19 March 2015, 26 May 2015, 3 July 2015, 16 October 2015, 22 December 2015, 31 December 2015, 31 March 2016 and 27 July 2016 respectively and the circular dated 30 June 2016. Other than disclosed elsewhere in this report, the Group did not have any significant investments held as at 31 March 2017. Other than disclosed elsewhere in this report, the Group has the following contingent liabilities: The Group has arranged bank financing for certain purchasers of property units developed by subsidiaries of the Group that provided guarantees to secure obligation of such purchasers for repayments. As at 31 March 2017, guarantees amounting to RMB971.0 million were given to banks with respect to loans procured by purchasers of property units (31 March 2016: RMB676.1 million). Such guarantees terminate upon the earlier of (i) issuance of the real estate ownership certificate to the purchasers or (ii) the satisfaction of mortgage loan by the purchasers of properties. Pursuant to the terms of the guarantees, upon default in mortgage payments by these purchasers, the Group is responsible to repay the outstanding mortgage principals together with accrued interest and penalty owed by the defaulted purchasers to the banks and the Group is entitled to take over the legal title and possession of the related properties. The Group’s guarantee period starts from the dates of grant of the mortgages. During the year, the Group did not incur any material losses in respect of any of these guarantees. The Directors consider that the likelihood of default in payments by the purchasers is minimal and therefore the financial guarantee measured at fair value is immaterial. Also, in case of default in payments, the net realizable value of the related property units would be sufficient to repay the outstanding mortgage loans together with any accrued interest and penalty, and therefore no provision has been made in connection with the guarantees.

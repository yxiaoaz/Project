During the year, the Group continued to use its best endeavors to meet passengers’ demands and to improve its operational efficiency. The route re- organisations in the Western District of the Hong Kong Island were completed in last financial year and the management was pleased to see that some of the re- organised routes effectively minimised the negative impact brought by the MTR West Island Line. Therefore, the focus of the route re-organisations of the year was mainly on meeting the growing demand in Tai Po District and providing feeder service to the SIL. During the year, the Group completed a series of route re-organisations involving 23 franchised PLB routes and two residents’ bus routes. Five new PLB ancillary routes were launched and three of them were to provide feeder services to the SIL in Aberdeen, Stanley and Wong Chuk Hang areas. Therefore, as at 31 March 2017, the number of PLB routes operated by the Group increased by 5 to 70 (2016: 65) and the number of PLBs operated by the Group also increased by 9 or 2.5% to 363 (2016: 354). The franchised PLB service is the third most popular mode of public transport (in terms of number of passenger journeys) in Hong Kong. The role of franchised PLBs is to provide supplementary feeder service to railways and to serve areas where the use of high-capacity transport is not cost effective. As at 31 March 2017, the number of licensed green minibuses in Hong Kong increased by 76 or 2.4% to 3,286 (2016: 3,210). The patronage of the franchised PLB sector for the year increased by 6.8% to 599 million (2016: 561 million), representing around 12.9% of the total public transport patronage in Hong Kong (2016: 12.2%). The growth in patronage of the franchised PLB sector was mainly attributable to natural growth and the increase in short-haul feeder services routes following the opening of the MTR West Island Line, the MTR Kwun Tong Line extension and the SIL. AMS’s objective is to propel the Group into a prominent market position by providing the public with reliable, safe and comfortable journeys, and hence maximising stakeholders’ value. The Group endeavors to achieve its objective by maintaining a team of management expertise which puts continuous effort in improving fleet productivity, efficiency and service quality, and carrying out stringent repair and maintenance programmes for the sake of safety. During the year, the Group deployed new LPG minibuses to replace aged minibuses. LPG minibuses which have zero emission of suspended particulates are more environmental-friendly choice of vehicles. Nevertheless, the operators need to face the problem of insufficient numbers of LPG filling stations in Hong Kong. Although the Group’s current plan is to replace aged minibuses with LPG minibuses in the coming one and a half years, the management may consider deploying latest emission standard diesel minibuses in the future when the loss in business time owing to longer travelling distances and waiting time for LPG refilling become material. In order to facilitate the access of wheelchair users to PLBs, the Group is going to roll out a new lower-floor wheelchair accessible minibus for trial to hospital routes by the end of 2017. The management would review the operational effectiveness of the wheelchair- accessible minibus, including the feasibility of technical and R&M operation and passengers’ feedback, and then communicate the trial results to the Transport Department. To support the Government’s environmental protection policy and help to improve the air quality in Hong Kong, the Group deployed two new hybrid minibuses in late 2013 and mid 2015 respectively. However, the result of the 24-month trial revealed that the average fuel costs of the hybrid minibuses were slightly higher than that of diesel minibuses, and the average utilisation rate of the hybrid minibuses was significantly lower than diesel minibus (i.e. 70% for hybrid minibus vs 94% for diesel minibus) due to hybrid minibuses’ unstable performance and need for frequent maintenance. Since the long downtime considerably hinders the operation, the Group has decided not to further deploy the same or similar model of hybrid minibuses in its current replacement plan. Nevertheless, the Group would continue to explore environmentally friendly and energy-saving vehicles which could meet its operational needs in the future. During the year, there was no change in the number of routes and the fleet size of the residents’ bus operations, which remained at 4 (2016: 4) and 6 (2016: 6) respectively as at 31 March 2017. With the expanded fleet size, increased number of short-haul feeder routes and better operational efficiency, the total mileage traveled by the Group for the year increased by 0.5% to around 42.2 million kilometers (2016: 42.0 million kilometers) and the patronage of the Group for the year slightly increased by 1.8% to around 58.1 million (2016: 57.1 million). On the other hand, the Group was granted approval to raise the fares in 13 routes at rates1 ranging from 3.2% to 13.6% (2016: 21 routes at rates ranging from 4.5% to 9.4%). As a result, the revenue for the year grew by HK$6,385,000 or 1.7% to HK$377,663,000 (2016: HK$371,278,000). The SIL commenced service on 28 December 2016. While the SIL feeder services are fast and convenient enough to attract the passengers, the patronage of other long-haul cross districts routes (with higher fares) decreased. Overall, a slight drop in the revenue was recorded but it did not bring significant impact to the financial performance of the reporting year. The Group will pro-actively reflect the latest road transport conditions to the Transport Department and propose re-organisations to the new ancillary routes to better re-allocate the resources to the routes with increasing demand. Since the public transport re-organisation in the Southern District is in its early stage, the management is confident that through continuous improvement in the route design and service frequency, the impact of the SIL on the Group’s performance could be minimised. For the sake of comfort of passengers and operational efficiency, the Group replaced 57 aged PLBs with brand new long-wheeled LPG PLBs during the year. Hence, the average fleet age was reduced to 10.1 years as at 31 March 2017 (31 March 2016: 11.5 years). The Group aims at further replacing around 100 aged PLBs before the end of 2019. The Group deployed 190 diesel minibuses (2016: 236), 172 LPG minibuses (2016: 116) and 1 hybrid minibuses (2016: 2) as at 31 March 2017. The rates refer to the increment in full fares of the routes. The Group was granted approval to raise the fares of 13 routes at rates ranging from 3.2% to 13.6% during the year (2016: 21 routes at rates ranging from 4.5% to 9.4%). Coupled with the patronage growth of 1.8%, the revenue for the year increased by HK$6,385,000 o r 1 . 7 % t o H K $ 3 7 7 , 6 6 3 , 0 0 0 ( 2 0 1 6 : HK$371,278,000). During the year, the advertising income of the Group decreased by HK$1,353,000 or 25.4% to HK$3,978,000 (2016: HK$5,331,000) due to the termination of a licensing agreement for broadcasting multimedia television inside its PLB compartments since February 2016. On the other hand, the Group received ex-gratia payments totaling HK$1,848,000 from the Government upon the disposal of pre-Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles during the year (2016: Nil). As a result, the other revenue of the Group increased by HK$390,000 or 4.7% to HK$8,603,000 (2016: HK$8,213,000). For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recorded a profit attributable to equity holders of HK$30,416,000 (2016: HK$29,426,000). The details of the consolidated results are presented below: Increase/(Decrease) In % Direct costs for the year was HK$303,844,000 (2016: HK$299,015,000), representing an increase of HK$4,829,000 or 1.6% as compared with that for last year. The major direct costs of the Group were captains’ costs, PLB rental expenses, fuel costs and R&M costs, which altogether made up around 94.3% of the total direct costs (2016: 94.3%) for the year ended 31 March 2017. The changes on these major costs are as follows: Captains’ costs: The industry-wide labour shortage problem was not improved during the year. In order to attract and retain captains, the management adjusted captains’ pay by three batches at an average rate of 4% each time during the year. The total labour costs of captains increased by HK$5,599,000 or 4.2% to HK$138,323,000 (2016: HK$132,724,000) as compared with last year; PLB rental expenses: Since the Group purchased a PLB licence and the corresponding minibus from a former lessor during the year, the number of leased PLBs reduced by one to 297 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 298). Its effect to the PLB rental expenses was offset by the increased use of brand-new leased PLBs with higher hiring rates. As a result, the PLB rental expenses slightly increased by HK$187,000 or 0.2% to Fuel costs: The average diesel unit price for the year slightly increased by 0.8% while the average unit price of LPG went down by 0.6% as compared with last year. Combining the effect of the 1.3% increase in average fleet size and increased use of LPG minibuses during the year, the fuel costs for the year slightly increased by HK$141,000 or 0.3% to HK$41,982,000 (2016: R&M costs: The Group deployed 57 new PLBs and 3 new PBs to replace the aged vehicles during the year and hence the average fleet age was reduced to 10.1 years as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 11.5 years). In additional to promoting comfort of passengers by using new vehicles, better mechanical reliability of the new vehicles also reduced the R&M costs by 3.7% or HK$1,182,000 to HK$30,954,000 (2016: HK$32,136,000). The administrative and other operating expenses i n c r e a s e d b y H K $ 1 , 7 9 4 , 0 0 0 o r 4 . 7 % t o HK$39,844,000 (2016: HK$38,050,000), which was primarily due to the surging staff costs. Apart from payrise, the Group also increased the headcount of the operations team to manage the enlarged service scale during the year. Therefore, the administrative staff costs increased by approximately HK$2,420,000 or 8.6% to HK$30,532,000 (2016: HK$28,112,000). Its effect was partially offset by the absence of the share-based compensation expense of HK$1,316,000 recognised for the grant of share options to administrative staff members in last year. The finance costs of the Group for the year increased by HK$132,000 or 4.4% to HK$3,099,000 (2016: HK$2,967,000) owing to the increase in average bank loans balances as a result of financing the purchase of PLB licences and PLBs. The average borrowing interest rate of the Group for the year was 2.09% (2016: 2.08%), at a level similar to last year. During the year, income tax expense decreased by HK$424,000 or 6.3% to HK$6,319,000 (2016: HK$6,743,000). Excluding the non-deductible effect of deficit on revaluation of PLB licences and the non- taxable effect on the excess of sales proceeds on disposal of pre-Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles (including ex-gratia payments received from the Government) over the capital expenditure incurred on the vehicles being disposed of, the effective tax rate for the year was 16.1% (2016: 16.7%). The Hong Kong profits tax rate applicable to the Group during the year was 16.5% (2016: 16.5%). For the purpose of meeting the passenger demand in Tai Po District and providing feeder service to the SIL, the Group enlarged the fleet by acquiring ten PLB licences with ten corresponding PLBs at a total consideration of HK$51,030,000 during the year. To finance the above acquisition, the Group carried out a series of refinancing arrangement with the banks. The net amount of borrowings incepted from the refinancing arrangement was HK$43,061,000. There was no material change in the market value of PLB licences as at 31 March 2017 compared with last year end. As compared with the 1.1% decrease in last year, the fair value of a PLB licence was slightly reduced by 1.5% to HK$5,100,000 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: HK$5,180,000). The deficit on revaluation of PLB licences charged to the Group’s consolidated income statement hence was up by HK$1,180,000 or 56.2% to HK$3,280,000 (2016: HK$2,100,000). Since the Group acquired ten PLB licences during the year, the carrying amount of the P L B l i c e n c e s o f t h e G r o u p i n c r e a s e d t o HK$336,600,000 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: HK$290,080,000). Please also refer to note 16 to the financial statements for more information on the carrying amount of PLB licences. As at 31 March 2017, the Group’s net current assets decreased by HK$9,387,000 or 20.7% to HK$35,904,000 (2016: HK$45,291,000) and its current ratio (current assets/ current liabilities) went down to 1.99 (2016: 2.29). The decrease in the balance of net current assets and current ratio was mainly attributable to: the decrease in bank balances and cash by HK$3,917,000 or 5.9% to HK$62,071,000 as at 31 March 2017 (2016: HK$65,988,000) as explained in the decrease in trade and other receivables by HK$5,313,000 or 37.2% to HK$8,978,000 (2016: HK$14,291,000), which was mainly due to the fact that a deposit amounting to HK$4,900,000 paid in last year for acquiring a PLB licence was recognised as “PLB licence“ in the balance sheet during the year. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had bank balances and cash amounting to HK$62,071,000 (2016: HK$65,988,000). All of the bank balances and cash as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 99.8%) were denominated in Hong Kong dollars. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had bank facilities totaling HK$200,027,000 (2016: HK$151,317,000), of which HK$175,727,000 (2016: HK$142,017,000) were utilised. As at 31 March 2017, the balance of total borrowings of the Group increased by HK$33,710,000 or 23.7% to HK$175,727,000 (2016: HK$142,017,000). This was a result of the inception of new borrowings totaling HK$43,061,000 during the year for the purpose of acquiring PLB licences and PLBs, partially offset by the scheduled repayments amounting to HK$9,351,000. The maturity profiles of the borrowings are as follows: According to the applicable accounting standards, the PLB licences are revalued with reference to their market value at each reporting date. Nevertheless, instead of holding for investment purpose, all the PLB licences owned by the Group are for operational use. The accounting revaluation of the PLB licences should be considered separately because the volatility of their market value has no significant impact on the Group’s core operation. Net cash from/(used in) During the year, the net cash from operating activities decreased by HK$4,866,000 or 11.0% to HK$39,495,000, as a result of the increase in income tax payment. The net cash used in investing activities for the year was HK$52,750,000, which HK$46,130,000 was for purchasing PLB licences and the corresponding PLBs. The net cash from financing activities was HK$9,338,000, which included the net proceeds of HK$43,061,000 received from the banks for financing the purchase of PLB licences and PLBs, partially offset by the scheduled repayment of bank borrowings amounting to HK$9,351,000 and the dividends payment to the equity holders of the Company in the sum of HK$27,077,000. Please refer to the consolidated cash flow statement and note 33 to the financial statements contained in this annual report for further details. The Group’s operations are mainly financed by proceeds from its operations. The Group carefully assesses and monitors its liquidity to ensure that it has sufficient cash and standby bank facilities to meet its daily operational needs. The Group is exposed to fuel price risk. The fluctuations in the fuel prices could be significant to the operations of the Group. However, having carefully evaluated the market conditions, the Group’s internal resources and the possible outcomes of entering into hedging derivatives, the Board concluded that entering into hedging contracts might not necessarily be an effective tool to manage the fuel price risk. Therefore, the Group did not have any hedging policies over its anticipated fuel consumption during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016. The management will continue to closely monitor the changes in market condition. The Group did not have any material contingent liabilities as at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016. Since the minibus industry is labour intensive in nature, staff costs accounted for a substantial part of the total operating costs of the Group. Apart from the basic remuneration, double pay and/or discretionary bonus are granted to eligible employees taking into account the Group’s performance and individual’s contribution. Other benefits including share option scheme, retirement plan and training schemes are also provided to the staff members. Employee b e n e f i t e x p e n s e s i n c u r r e d f o r t h e y e a r w e r e HK$182,347,000 (2016: HK$174,849,000), representing 51.6% (2016: 50.4%) of the total costs (excluding the deficit on revaluation of PLB licences and the provision for impairment of PB licences). For the headcount of the Group, please refer to the Environmental, Social and Governance Report of this annual report. The Group early repaid three borrowings totaling HK$12,797,000 in April 2017, whose interest rate terms were less favourable compared with the new facilities obtained by the Group. Subsequent to the balance sheet date and up to 29 June 2017, based on the valuation estimated by the directors, the average market price of a PLB licence further dropped to approximately HK$4,660,000 compared with its fair value of HK$5,100,000, as valued by Vigers, as at 31 March 2017. Therefore, the unaudited deficit on revaluation of PLB licences charged to the consolidated income statement and the PLB licences revaluation reserve for the period from 1 April 2017 to 29 June 2017 were approximately HK$19,800,000 and HK$9,240,000 respectively. The gearing ratio (total liabilities/shareholders’ equity) as at 31 March 2017 increased to 77.6% (2016: 66.1%) due to the increase in the balance of borrowings by HK$33,710,000 or 23.7% to HK$175,727,000 (2016: HK$142,017,000). The Group has pledged certain assets to secure the banking facilities obtained. Details of the pledged assets as at year end are as follows: The total capital expenditure for the year was HK$58,960,000 (2016: HK$1,604,000), which was mainly for purchasing ten PLB licences and ten corresponding PLBs at a total consideration of HK$51,030,000 and for purchasing seven new PLBs and three new PBs at total costs of HK$6,980,000 for replacing the aged ones. As at 31 March 2017, the capital commitment was HK$3,307,000 (2016: HK$1,230,000) which was mainly for purchasing new PLBs. The income of the franchised PLB operation of the Group is either received in cash or collected via Octopus Cards Limited and remitted to the Group on the next business day. Also, the Group does not provide guarantees to third parties which would expose the Group to credit risk. The Group is therefore not exposed to any significant credit risk. The Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk as the majority of income and expenditures of its operating activities, monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its bank balances and borrowings. All borrowings as at 31 March 2017 were denominated in Hong Kong dollars and on a floating interest rate basis. The practice effectively eliminates the currency risk and the management is of the view that the Group is not subject to significant interest rate risk. Finance costs accounted for around 0.9% (2016: 0.9%) of the total costs of the Group for the reporting year. Any reasonably possible changes in the market interest rates would not bring significant impact to the Group.

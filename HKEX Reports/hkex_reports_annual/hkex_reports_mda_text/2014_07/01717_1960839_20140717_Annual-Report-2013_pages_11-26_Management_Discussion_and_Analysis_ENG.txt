(47.2) (10.6) – Group (including the Ausnutria Hyproca Group) (2.0) (0.1) – Group (including the Ausnutria Hyproca Group) – Group (including the Ausnutria Hyproca Group) (3.7) (1.0) (0.1) – Group (including the Ausnutria Hyproca Group) For the Year 2013, the Group recorded revenue of approximately RMB1,687.8 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB336.8 million, or approximately 24.9%, from approximately RMB1,351.0 million for the Year 2012. The increase is mainly attributable to (i) the increase in sales of the Ausnutria Group by approximately 20.5%; and (ii) the contribution of revenue by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as a result of the continuous increases in the demand for paediatric nutrition products from its customers in the Netherlands and other overseas countries. During the Year 2013, A-choice Series, Best-choice Series, Allnutria Series and Allnutria Organic Series continued to be the major series of paediatric milk formula of the Ausnutria Group which are all imported from overseas and are designed to target consumers for premium products in the PRC. During the Year 2012 and the Year 2013, the Ausnutria Group has also commenced the launch of other imported cow milk infant formula, namely the Puredo Series in June 2012 and the Hyproca 1897 Series in April 2013, which are targeted to penetrate into different sectors of the PRC. The revenue derived from the Puredo Series and the Hyproca 1897 Series of products in the PRC was approximately RMB54.3 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB30.7 million) and approximately RMB41.3 million (Year 2012: Nil), respectively. The increase in the revenue of the Ausnutria Group was in line with the continuous increase in demand for infant milk formula in the PRC, particularly those imported from the overseas. The Ausnutria Hyproca Group is principally engaged in the dairy industry from research and development, milk collection, processing, production and packaging of dairy products with production facilities and milk sources in the Netherlands for own labels as well as under original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) and private label arrangements. The OEM and private label arrangements are serving cow milk dairy products to customers in the Netherlands and other overseas countries, such as the PRC, Taiwan, other European and Middle East countries. The Ausnutria Hyproca Group also sells paediatric milk formula under its own brands (Kabrita for goat infant formula (“Kabrita”) in the PRC, Russia and the Middle East countries and Neolac for cow infant formula in the PRC). The Ausnutria Hyproca Group is one of the leading producers and distributors of goat milk products in the world. The increase in the revenue of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the Year 2013 was primarily attributed to (i) the continuous increase in the revenue of Kabrita to approximately RMB137.7 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB101.5 million, or approximately 280.4%, from the Year 2012; and (ii) the continuous increases in the demand for paediatric nutrition products from the customers in the Netherlands and other overseas countries due to the increasing recognition of the good quality of milk supply in the Netherlands and the reputation of good quality products delivered by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group that was built up since the establishment of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group in In order to cater for the increasing in demand, the Ausnutria Hyproca Group has commenced the improvement plans on increasing the production capacity of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group’s operations, including but not limited to the upgrade of the dry blending and package factory and the installation of a new kitchen for wet mix and a new spray tower in its factories since 2013. In addition, in January 2014, the Ausnutria Hyproca Group has purchased a parcel of land in the Industry Zone of Heerenveen, in the Netherlands, of about 140,000 square meters for the purpose of erecting a new factory. The Group has already completed the detailed design and feasibility study on the new factory and the Board is at the final stage of granting approval to proceed with such construction plan. The Group’s gross profit for the Year 2013 was approximately RMB471.8 million, representing an increase of approximately RMB145.6 million, or approximately 44.6%, when compared with the Year 2012. The gross profit margin of the Group for the Year 2013 increased from approximately 24.1% for the Year 2012 to 28.0%, primarily due to the improvement in the gross profit margin of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group which was adversely affected by the temporary interruption of the production as a result of the delivery of some possible contaminated raw materials by one of the supplement suppliers to the Ausnutria Hyproca Group during the Year 2012; and the increase in proportion of sales contributed by the own branded label business, namely, the Kabrita and the Neolac, which has contributed a higher gross profit margin when compared with the OEM and private label businesses of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. An analysis of other income and gains is as follows: (i) (ii) (i) The Group has entered into various one-year term entrusted fund management agreements with independent third parties since 2011. The Group invested in these treasury products offered by banks with a sole objective of maximising the return with limited risks on the then excess cash position of the Group. The entrusted loans were classified as held-to-maturity investments in the statement of financial position. The decrease in interest income on held-to-maturity investments was because the Group has adopted a more prudent treasury approach since 2012 by gradually reducing its investment in entrusted loans from RMB200.0 million in the Year 2011 to RMB60.0 million in the Year 2012. As at 31 December 2013, the Group did not have any investment in entrusted loans and all the excess cash of the Group was placed in time deposits with reputable financial institutions in the PRC instead. (ii) The increase in interest income was a result of the continuous improvements in the average bank balances of the Group and the change in treasury approach of the Group by switching its excess cash to time deposits when compared with the Year 2012. Also, the un-utilised portion of the proceeds from the global offering of the Shares in 2009 (the “IPO”) that was deposited in banks also contributed to the increase in interest income. An analysis of selling and distribution expenses is as follows: Selling and distribution expenses mainly comprised advertising and promotion expense, salaries and travelling costs of the sales and marketing staff and delivery costs. Selling and distribution costs represented approximately 13.5% and 11.6% of revenue for the Year 2013 and the Year 2012, respectively. The selling and distribution expenses of the Ausnutria Group for the Year 2013 remains stable when compared with the Year 2012 and represented approximately 22.3% (Year 2012: 24.6%) of the Ausnutria Group’s revenue. The selling and distribution expenses of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group represented approximately 8.4% and 4.2% of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group’s revenue for the Year 2013 and the Year 2012, respectively. The increase in the selling and distribution costs of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group was mainly attributed to (i) the increase in the sales and marketing expenses for the promotion of the Kabrita Series of products in the PRC by approximately RMB18.4 million to approximately RMB53.9 million; and (ii) the increase in sales of the other operating subsidiaries of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. An analysis of the administrative expenses is as follows: Administrative expenses mainly comprised staff costs, travelling expenses, auditors’ remuneration, professional fees, depreciation and research and development costs. Administrative expenses of the Ausnutria Group remained fairly stable during the Year 2013. The increase in the administrative expenses of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group was primarily attributed to the increase in headcounts on both the managerial and administrative staff to cope with the continuous increase in the scale of operations of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group, particular for the own branded label business, namely, Kabrita and Neolac in the PRC. The administrative expenses incurred from the own branded label business in the PRC increased by approximately RMB9.7 million to approximately RMB13.9 million for the Year 2013. Other expenses mainly comprised legal and professional fees incurred as a result of the Unresolved Issues of approximately RMB11.2 million (Year 2012: RMB14.1 million); write-off of trade receivables attributed to a number of distributors who have ceased trading with Ausnutria China of approximately RMB2.8 million (Year 2012: RMB1.9 million); exchange losses arising from the translation of bank deposits that were denominated in EURO and Hong Kong dollars to RMB of a total of approximately RMB1.1 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB0.2 million) and impairment on property, plant and equipment of approximately RMB1.9 million (Year 2012: Nil). The finance costs of the Group for the Year 2013 amounted to approximately RMB6.4 million (Year 2012: RMB4.3 million), representing the interest on bank loans and other borrowings principally for the financing of the working capital and the production expansion plan of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. The increase in finance costs was mainly attributable to the increase in the bank overdrafts facilities granted to the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the financing of its working capital and the draw down of a new bank loan of EURO 10.0 million (equivalent to approximately RMB84.0 million) in June 2013 by the Ausnutria Group for the financing of the production expansion plan of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. The profits generated by the Group were mainly derived from operations in the PRC and the Netherlands. Under the PRC income tax laws, enterprises are subject to corporate income tax (the “CIT”) at a rate of 25%. Ausnutria China was designated as a High-tech Enterprise in 2010 and was granted a preferential CIT tax rate of 15% for the three years ended 31 December 2012. All other subsidiaries established in the PRC are subject to the standard CIT rate of 25%. The standard CIT rate in the Netherlands was applied at 20% for the first EURO 200,000 taxable profits and 25% for the taxable profits exceeding EURO 200,000. In March 2014, Ausnutria China succeeded in renewing its High-tech Enterprise qualification, upon which Ausnutria China will continue to entitle to the preferential CIT tax rate of 15%, for another three years ending 31 December 2015. An analysis of the effective income tax rate by jurisdiction is as follows: Profit/(loss) before tax (RMB’M) (1.7) (20.8) (21.8) Income tax expense (RMB’M) (0.4) Effective income tax rate (%) (24.1) Most of the profits generated by the Group for the Year 2013 and the Year 2012 were derived in the Mainland China. The effective income tax rate for profit generated from Mainland China for the Year 2013 at 17.6% remained fairly stable when compared with the Year 2012. The effective income tax rate was slightly above the preferential CIT tax rate of 15% as part of the profit was contributed by the other operating subsidiary established in the PRC for the sale of Kabrita products which are subject to the standard CIT rate of 25%. The effective income tax rate for profit generated from the Netherlands for the Year 2013 of 10.1% was mainly due to there was tax incentive granted by the tax authority in the Netherlands for the research and development activities conducted by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group and the deferral of part of the profit tax as a result of the capital expenditures incurred by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group during the Year 2013. The effective income tax rate of the Group was slightly higher than the effective tax rate for profits generated from other jurisdictions as there were losses incurred from elsewhere mainly for the professional fees incurred for the handling of the Unresolved Issues and the administrative expenses incurred by the Company. As the Company (which was incorporated solely for investment holding purpose) did not generate any assessable profits for the Year 2013 and the Year 2012, the expenses incurred were not tax deductible. The Group’s profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the Year 2013 amounted to approximately RMB120.7 million, representing an increase of approximately 81.5% when compared with the Year 2012. The increase in net profit was mainly contributed by the growth in the operating performance of the Ausnutria Group as a result of the increasing in market demand of import infant milk powder from the PRC. The increase was partly offset by the adverse impact of the temporary interruption on the production of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as a result of the production expansion plan which had caused one of the two milk powder production towers of Hyproca Lyempf to be suspended from production for approximately four months in the Year 2013. As at 31 December 2013, the total non-current assets of the Group amounted to approximately RMB511.9 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB406.3 million), mainly comprised property, plant and equipment of approximately RMB361.0 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB264.3 million), goodwill arising from the acquisition of Ausnutria Hyproca of approximately RMB85.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB84.5 million), other intangible assets of approximately RMB33.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB30.1 million) and deferred tax assets of approximately RMB29.8 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB25.3 million). The increase in the non-current assets of the Group as at 31 December 2013 was principally due to the increase in property, plant and equipment of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as part of its continuous production expansion plan to cope with the increasing demand of its products from the worldwide customers. The amount of capital expenditures invested by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the Year 2013 amounted to approximately RMB126.2 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB32.5 million). Other non-current assets position of the Group as at 31 December 2013 remained fairly stable when compared with that as at 31 December 2012. As at 31 December 2013, the total current assets of the Group amounted to approximately RMB1,490.8 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB1,182.1 million), mainly comprised inventories of approximately RMB315.7 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB190.9 million), trade receivables of approximately RMB140.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB122.6 million), bills receivable of approximately RMB35.1 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB18.7 million), pledged time deposits of approximately RMB213.0 million (31 December 2012: Nil), time deposits with banks in the PRC of RMB496.3 million (31 December 2012: RMB420.0 million) and cash and cash equivalents of approximately RMB161.2 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB282.7 million). An analysis of the inventories is as follows: The increase in inventories as at 31 December 2013 was primarily attributed to the increase in the inventory level of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group in order to cope with the continuous increase in demand of its products from its worldwide customers including its own branded labels, namely, Kabrita and Neolac. The Ausnutria Hyproca Group has maintained a greater variety of raw materials and packaging materials in order to meet the growing demand from the customers. The inventory turnover days of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as at 31 December 2013 was approximately 71 days (31 December 2012: approximately 54 days) and was in line with the stock planning level. The inventory turnover days of the Ausnutria Group as at 31 December 2013 was approximately 93 days (31 December 2012: approximately 169 days). In 2012, there was a temporary delay in the delivery on some of the orders by the suppliers of the Ausnutria Group in the fourth quarter of 2012 which had caused the inventory level to be at a comparatively lower level. The inventory level as at 31 December 2013 was in line with the normal inventory planning level of the Ausnutria Group. An analysis of the trade and bills receivables is as follows: Trade receivables: The trade receivable turnover days of the Ausnutria Group and the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as at 31 December 2013 was approximately 20 days (31 December 2012: approximately 22 days) and approximately 33 days (31 December 2012: approximately 39 days), respectively, which remained fairly stable and were in line with the credit periods granted by the Group to its customers. As set out in the announcements of the Company dated 7 June 2013 and 5 November 2013, the Company has approved to grant two shareholders’ loans of EURO 7.0 million (equivalent to approximately RMB58.8 million) (31 December 2012: Nil) and EURO 10.0 million (equivalent to approximately RMB84.0 million) (31 December 2012: Nil) for the financing of the production expansion plans of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. In view that most of the funding of the Ausnutria Group is denominated in RMB and placed in the PRC, the Ausnutria Group has pledged its RMB deposits in the PRC of a total of RMB213.0 million (31 December 2012: Nil) to obtain the bank facilities in Europe for the financing of the shareholders’ loans and other capital expenditure needs of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group in the near future. As at 31 December 2013, the Group’s cash and bank balances and time deposits amounted to approximately RMB657.5 million, representing a decrease of approximately RMB45.2 million, or approximately 6.4%, from RMB702.7 million as at 31 December 2012, of which approximately HK$109.1 million (31 December 2012: approximately HK$174.3 million) represented the unutilised portion of the proceeds from the IPO. For details regarding the changes in the above, please refer to the “Analysis on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows” section of this report. As at 31 December 2013, the total current liabilities of the Group amounted to approximately RMB722.7 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB440.6 million), mainly comprised trade payables of approximately RMB168.0 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB104.7 million), other payables and accruals of approximately RMB256.6 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB229.7 million), interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings of approximately RMB260.0 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB95.6 million) and CIT payables of approximately RMB37.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB9.5 million). An analysis of the trade payables is as follows: The increase in trade payables of the Group as at 31 December 2013 was mainly attributable to the increase in the amount of procurement as a result of the increase in the scale of production of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group which was driven by the continuous increase in worldwide demand of dairy products originated in the Netherlands. The trade payable turnover days of the Ausnutria Group and the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as at 31 December 2013 was approximately 16 days (31 December 2012: approximately 24 days) and approximately 47 days (31 December 2012: approximately 37 days), respectively. The increase in the trade payable turnover days of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group was a result of the increase in average credit periods granted by the major suppliers due to the increase in quantity of raw materials purchased by the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. Other payables and accruals mainly represented advances and deposits from customers of a total of approximately RMB60.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB100.9 million), deferred income of approximately RMB70.1 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB46.9 million), accrued salaries and welfare of approximately RMB25.3 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB21.7 million), other tax payables of approximately RMB14.7 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB4.0 million) and accrued marketing and promotion expenses and professional fees. The increase in other payables and accruals was mainly due to the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of the Year 2013 when compared with the same period of the Year 2012. More accruals are required to be made for the deferred revenue that were recognised by the distributors and end customers, and the marketing and promotion expenses that were incurred but not yet settled as at the end of the reporting period. The interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings as at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were all primarily used for the financing of the daily working capital and capital expenditures of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group. The increase in the interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings as at 31 December 2013 was mainly due to (i) the increase in the bank overdrafts of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the financing of its daily working capital; and (ii) the draw down of a one-year term loan by Ausnutria (Dutch) for the financing of the capital expenditure plan of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as set out in the announcement of the Company dated 7 June 2013. As at 31 December 2013, the total non-current liabilities of the Group amounted to approximately RMB85.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB84.0 million), mainly comprised interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings of approximately RMB36.9 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB39.0 million), accruals for defined benefit plan of approximately RMB18.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB17.4 million) and deferred tax liabilities of approximately RMB30.2 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB27.6 million). The interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings as at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were all attributed to the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the financing of its daily working capital and capital expenditures. The Ausnutria Hyproca Group operates unfunded defined benefit plans for its qualified employees. Under the plans, the qualified employees are entitled to retirement benefits at rates varying at certain percentage of their final salaries on attainment of a retirement age of 65. The accruals for defined benefit plans of approximately RMB18.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB17.4 million) were determined based on the actuarial valuations as at 31 December 2013 carried out by independent professional valuers using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. No defined benefit plan was operated by the Ausnutria Group. The balance represented (i) the tax effect arising from the timing differences on the depreciation and amortisation charged between accounting and tax reporting purpose that was attributed to the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as at 31 December 2013 and the fair value adjustment arising from the acquisition of Ausnutria Hyproca of a total of approximately RMB18.5 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB21.4 million); and (ii) the withholding tax amounting to approximately RMB11.7 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB6.2 million) calculated at 10% on the distributable profits of Ausnutria China. Pursuant to the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared to foreign investors from foreign investment enterprises established in the PRC. The requirement is effective from 1 January 2008 and applies to earnings after 31 December 2007. As at 31 December 2013 and 2012, the balance mainly represented the 49% equity interests in Ausnutria Hyproca owned by DDI. An extract of the cash flows information of the Group for the Year 2013 and the Year 2012 is as follows: (361.9) (205.3) (23.5) (119.8) (60.7) Net cash flows from operating activities of the Group for the Year 2013 was approximately RMB82.6 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB168.1 million), while the profit before tax for that year was approximately RMB157.8 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB85.4 million). The net difference between the profit before tax and net cash flows from operating activities was mainly attributable to the increase in the scale of operations of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group which has required additional working capital for the business expansion. The increase in working capital needs of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group was partly financed by the increase in trade credit granted by its suppliers and partly by the increase in the bank overdrafts facilities in the Netherlands. The net cash flows used in investing activities of the Group for the Year 2013 of approximately RMB361.9 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB205.3 million) mainly represented (i) the purchase of property, plant and equipment of approximately RMB126.7 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB40.3 million), mainly for the expansion of the production capacity of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group; (ii) the increase in pledged time deposits of RMB213.0 million (Year 2012: Nil); and (iii) the net increase in the Group’s time deposits with banks in the PRC by RMB76.3 million (Year 2012: RMB310.0 million); which was offset by the net proceeds received from the investments in the entrusted loans of RMB60.0 million (Year 2012: RMB140.0 million). The net cash flows from financing activities of the Group for the Year 2013 of approximately RMB159.5 million (Year 2012: used in of approximately RMB23.5 million) was primarily due to the draw down of the additional overdrafts facilities of approximately EURO 8.0 million (equivalent to approximately RMB67.2 million) granted by the bank of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group for the financing of its daily working capital and the draw down of a one-year term loan by Ausnutria (Dutch) of EURO 10.0 million (equivalent to approximately RMB84.0 million) for the financing of the capital expenditure plan of the Ausnutria Hyproca Group as set in the announcement of the Company on 7 June 2013. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the Year 2012 mainly represented the acquisition of the remaining 8.4% equity interests in Hyproca Lyempf, a 91.6% owned subsidiary of Ausnutria Hyproca at a consideration of EURO 2.8 million (equivalent to approximately RMB23.0 million). There were no material investments and acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and associated companies during the Year 2013. The Group adopts conservative financial management policies. A summary of liquidity and financial resources is set out below: Cash and cash equivalents (RMB’M) Time deposits (RMB’M) Total bank loans and other borrowings (RMB’M) Total assets (RMB’M) Gearing ratio (%) (1) Note: Calculated as a percentage of total bank loans and other borrowings over total assets. As at 31 December 2013, the Group had pledged the land and buildings, plant and machineries, inventories and trade receivables that were attributable to the Ausnutria Hyproca Group with a total carrying value of EURO 68.0 million, equivalent to approximately RMB572.2 million (31 December 2012: approximately EURO 42.9 million, equivalent to approximately RMB357.1 million) and the time deposits that were attributable to the Ausnutria Group of RMB213.0 million (31 December 2012: Nil) for the banking facilities granted to the Group. The operations of the Group are mainly carried out in the PRC and the Netherlands. During the Year 2013, revenue, cost of sales and operating expenses of the Group are mainly denominated in Renminbi (“RMB”), Hong Kong dollars (“HK$”), United States dollars (“US$”) or EURO and RMB is the Group’s presentation currency. The Group is exposed to potential foreign exchange risk as a result of fluctuation of HK$, US$ or EURO against RMB. The Group did not enter into any arrangements for the purpose of hedging against the potential foreign exchange risks during the year under review. The management will monitor closely on its foreign currency exposure to ensure appropriate measures are taken promptly against any significant potential adverse impact. The Ausnutria Hyproca Group has exposure to the risk of change in market interest rate in relation to its interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings with a floating interest rate. In order to minimise the impact of the interest rate exposure, the Ausnutria Hyproca Group entered into interest rate swap contracts with bank, effective from 1 October 2007, of a notional amount of EURO 2.5 million with 3-month floating EURO Interbank Offered Rate being swapped to a fixed interest rate of 4.45% per annum. The aforesaid derivative financial instrument will expire in October 2017. The above interest rate swap contracts are revalued at their fair values as at each of 31 December 2013 and 2012. The Group seeks to maintain strict control over its outstanding receivables and closely monitors the collection to minimize credit risk. As the Group’s exposure spreads over a diversified portfolio of customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and bill receivables, deposits and other receivables represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the Group’s other financial assets. As at 31 December 2013, the Group, as lessee, had total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounting to approximately RMB6.6 million (31 December 2012: approximately RMB4.8 million). As at 31 December 2013, the Group had contracted, but not provided for, capital commitments in respect of purchase of plant and machineries and leasehold improvements of a total of RMB23.3 million (31 December 2012: RMB11.8 million). As at 31 December 2013, the Group did not have any significant contingent liabilities (31 December 2012: Nil). The Shares were listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange on 8 October 2009 with net proceeds from the IPO of approximately HK$823.1 million (after deducting underwriting commissions and related expenses) (the “Net IPO Proceeds”). The use of the Net IPO Proceeds from the IPO up to 31 December 2013 was as follows: As stated in the Prospectus* Balance as at 31 December The remaining balance was deposited in reputable financial institutions in the PRC. The Directors intend to apply the remaining Net IPO Proceeds in the manner as stated in the prospectus of the IPO (the “Prospectus”) and as subsequently amended as set out in the announcement of the Company dated 8 September 2010 to place the utilised portion of the Net IPO Proceeds in short term deposits and short term treasury products with licensed banks and authorised financial institutions in Hong Kong and in the PRC. Mainland 31 December 2013 31 December 2012 For the Year 2013, total employee costs, including directors’ emoluments, amounted to approximately RMB189.8 million (Year 2012: approximately RMB136.2 million). The Group determined the remuneration packages of all employees with reference to individual performance and current market salary scale. The Group provides a defined contribution mandatory provident fund for retirement benefits of its employees in Hong Kong and various plans in either defined benefit or defined contribution arrangements for the retirement benefits of its employees in the Netherlands. The Group also provides various welfare schemes as required by the applicable local laws and regulations to its employees in the PRC.

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the significant slowdown of China’s economy has led to a general decrease in consumer confidence. At the same time, the Group has to face the pressure of rising food and labor costs. Notwithstanding the market condition, with more than 45 years of operating history in the food and catering sector, the Group has the experience to pass through several economic cycles in the past and the current downturn. Fortunately, the demand for high quality and moderately priced cuisine offered by “Tsui Wah” has remained strong. Thanks to the experienced Board and management of the Group, “Tsui Wah” has managed to overcome a number of challenges, increased the public recognition of the brand, and maintained as the leading Cha Chaan Teng chain owner and operator in Hong Kong mainly through serving delicious quality cuisine prepared under stringent quality control by monitoring the safety and quality of the foods. For the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group opened nine new restaurants in total across Hong Kong and the PRC, as compared to 10 in the year ended 31 March 2013. The three new restaurants in Hong Kong are located in Tung Chung, Tseung Kwan O and Tai Po. In the PRC, the Group has opened six new restaurants in Shanghai (Xuhui district and Pudong New Area), Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. As disclosed in the annual report of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group planned to open 12 restaurants in the year ended 31 March 2014, of which four would be located in Hong Kong and eight would be in the PRC. Due to the unexpected delay in completion of renovation of the Causeway Bay new restaurant, the Group was only able to open three new restaurants in Hong Kong during the year ended 31 March 2014. The new restaurant located in Causeway Bay was eventually opened in April 2014. In the PRC, fewer stores were opened than expected due to a number of reasons including changing market conditions and delays in receiving premises from the property owners. In spite of the slowdown in economic growth, the newly opened restaurants achieved satisfactory performance. This was mainly attributed to the Group’s prudent restaurant development planning and site selection. Important progress has been made in the further development of its delivery service “Tsui Wah Delivery” ( ), enabling customers to enjoy Hong Kong style and steaming hot “Tsui Wah” delights at their convenience. Whilst the “Tsui Wah Delivery” covered most areas in Kowloon, the Group has extended the delivery service to cover certain areas on the Hong Kong Island and in the New Territories during the year ended 31 March 2014. Moreover, cost management was improved for the year ended 31 March 2014 as the Group effectively and efficiently controlled and strengthened the procurement and supply chain management. In addition, by reducing wastage during food preparation, the gross profit margin of the Group has remained stable without sacrificing the quality, taste and safety of its foods. However, the Group’s net profit margin (profit for the year as a percentage of revenue) recorded a decrease from approximately 12.1% for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately 10.6% for the year ended 31 March 2014, which was mainly owing to the initial start up labour costs and property rental expenses for new restaurants. A strong operating and financial performance has been achieved for the year ended 31 March 2014. The revenue of the Group increased by approximately 35.9% from approximately HK$1,084.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$1,473.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2014 and net profit rose by approximately 18.8%, to approximately HK$156.0 million, in comparing to approximately HK$131.3 million in the preceding financial year. This was mainly attributable to the strong growth in restaurant sales due to the quality food offered, the establishment of new restaurants and introduction of new items to the Group’s menu from time to time. Profit attributable to owners of the Company increased by approximately 20.4% from approximately HK$129.6 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$156.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2014. The business environment for the food and catering sector has become increasingly harsh and challenging due to the rising food, rental and labour costs in recent years. However, the Group has strived to implement and maintain effective cost and expense controls and improved the overall operating efficiencies through a range of cost control measures. Cost of inventories sold increased by approximately HK$121.0 million, or approximately 36.4%, from approximately HK$332.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$453.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2014. The cost of inventories sold amounted to approximately 30.6% and 30.7% of the Group’s revenue for the year ended 31 March 2013 and 2014, respectively. The cost of inventories sold in proportion to the Group’s revenue remained stable for the year ended 31 March 2014 as compared to the preceding year is primarily reflecting that: (i) the Group’s policy in bulk procurement of ingredients, beverage and other operating items for the restaurant operation from suppliers has resulted in better purchase prices for these items; and (ii) the Group’s management and controlling measures over the food preparation process has reduced food waste. The Group’s gross profit, which equals to the revenue minus cost of inventories sold, for the year ended 31 March 2014 was approximately HK$1,020.7 million, representing a dramatic increase of approximately 35.7% from approximately HK$752.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2013. The increase was mainly due to the promising sales growth in the existing restaurants, opening of new restaurants and the introduction of new items to the Group’s menu from time to time which promise better profit margins. Staff costs of the Group increased by approximately HK$108.5 million, or approximately 37.8%, from approximately HK$286.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$395.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2014. Staff costs as a percentage of the Group’s revenue modestly increased from 26.4% for the year ended 31 March 2013 to 26.8% for the year ended 31 March 2014. The salary levels of employees in the food and catering sector has been generally rising in recent years. The increase was attributable to higher salaries and new staff recruited for the newly opened restaurants. The Group is of the opinion that the retention of experienced staff is vital in improving its operation and maintaining its well-established high-quality service across all of its restaurants. Property rentals and related expenses increased by approximately HK$56.9 million, or approximately 37.2%, from approximately HK$152.9 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$209.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2014, primarily because of (i) new restaurants premises leased during the year; and (ii) increase in rent when renewing leases. In order to realise a better control in the property rentals and related expenses, the Group has entered into long-term rental agreements with its landlord(s) so as to maintain the rentals at a reasonable level. Share of profits of joint ventures amounted to approximately HK$37.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2014, representing an increase of approximately HK$15.1 million, or approximately 68.6% from approximately HK$22.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2013. Such increase was mainly due to increase in sales of the Group’s joint ventures in Hong Kong and Macau. Income tax expense increased by approximately HK$7.0 million, or approximately 26.1%, from approximately HK$26.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$33.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2014. Such increase was mainly due to the increase in the Group’s taxable profit. As a result of the higher revenue attributable to the strong growth in restaurant sales due to the quality food offered, the establishment of new restaurants and introduction of new items to the Group’s menu from time to time, the profit before tax increased by approximately HK$31.7 million, or approximately 20.1%, from approximately HK$158.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2013 to approximately HK$189.8 million for the year ended 31 March 2014. For the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group had financed its business with internally generated cash flows and proceeds received from the listing of its shares on (the “Listing”) The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Stock Exchange”). As at 31 March 2014, the Group had cash and cash equivalents amounting to approximately HK$634.6 million, representing a decrease of approximately HK$282.3 million from approximately HK$916.9 million as at 31 March 2013. This was mainly attributable to the use of cash for (i) the acquisition of land-use right and buildings for the establishment of a larger central kitchen in Shanghai; (ii) the initial payment of earnest money and part of the contract price in relation to the construction of the central kitchen in Shanghai; (iii) acquisition of office premises in Shanghai; and (iv) acquisition of properties for the establishment of a central kitchen in Hong Kong. Most bank deposits and cash were denominated in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. As at 31 March 2014, the Group’s total current assets and current liabilities were approximately HK$713.6 million (as at 31 March 2013: approximately HK$969.6 million) and approximately HK$299.3 million (as at 31 March 2013: approximately HK$153.1 million) respectively, while the current ratio was about 2.4 times (as at 31 March 2013: about 6.3 times). The Group has finance lease payables of approximately HK$1.0 million as at 31 March 2014 (as at 31 March 2013: approximately HK$1.3 million) and interest-bearing bank borrowings of approximately HK$86.8 million as at 31 March 2014, all denominated in Hong Kong dollars (as at 31 March 2013: Nil). During the year ended 31 March 2014, no financial instruments were used for hedging purposes. As at 31 March 2014, the Group’s gearing ratio, which was calculated based on the sum of interest-bearing bank borrowings and finance lease payables over equity attributable to owners of the Company, was approximately 7.6% (as at 31 March 2013: approximately 0.1%). The ordinary shares of the Company (the “Shares”) were listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange on 26 November 2012 with net proceeds from the global offering of the Company of approximately HK$794.4 million (after deducting underwriting fees and related expenses). The use of the net proceeds from the global offering as at 31 March 2014 was approximately as follows: (in HK$ million) (in HK$ million) (in HK$ million) (81.7) (194.2) (79.4) (79.4) (6.2) (79.4) (520.3) The Group’s sales and purchases for the year ended 31 March 2014 were mostly denominated in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi. As Renminbi is a not a freely convertible currency, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars against Renminbi may have an impact on the Group’s results. Although foreign currency exposure did not pose a significant risk for the Group, the Group will continue to take proactive measures and monitor closely of its exposure to such currency movement. As at 31 March 2014, the Group had contingent liabilities of approximately HK$2.2 million (31 March 2013: approximately HK$1.5 million) in respect of bank guarantee given in favour of landlords in lieu of rental deposits. As at 31 March 2014, the Group (other than the joint ventures) employed approximately 3,670 employees. Remuneration packages are generally structured by reference to market terms, individual qualifications and experience. The Group reviews the remuneration of the employees from time to time. During the year ended 31 March 2014, various training activities covering operational safety and management skills as well as a mentorship programme, have been arranged to improve the front-end quality of services as well as to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the Group’s business and operational policies. The Group has continued to implement its Management Trainee Program to enhance the depth and breadth of the skill set of the management staff for their further career development. Moving forward, maintaining stringent food safety and a satisfactory dining experience will remain the Group’s core focuses. The Group aims to provide its customers with hygienic and quality food and a good value-for-money dining experience. To achieve this objective, the Group’s first central kitchen in Shanghai has commenced its operation in June 2013 and the Group subsequently acquired the land-use right and buildings in Shanghai to establish a larger central kitchen to support its expanding restaurant network. The opening of central kitchens will further strengthen the Group’s quality and hygiene standards, boost its operational efficiency and standardise its quality control and management. The management of the Company will ensure that food safety and customer satisfaction remains as the Group’s top priority. In the year ahead, the Group is adhering to its objective as disclosed upon its Listing by implementing the stated store-opening strategy and expects to operate more than 80 restaurants by 2017, so as to increase the Group’s market share in both Hong Kong and the PRC and enhance its brand awareness. Adhering to its core corporate values and beliefs, the Group is committed to bearing corporate social responsibilities. The Group actively encourages employees to participate in charitable activities and has provided in- kind support and sponsored various community charitable activities to raise funds to people in need. At the same time, the Group promotes environmental protection, including the implementation of green procurement and energy saving policies, and also encourages customers to choose a green diet and reduce food waste. The Group is always prepared to take a proactive role in giving back what it could afford to the society. PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK (Continued) In respect to the market in Hong Kong, with the acquisition of properties in the New Territories, the Group will establish a second central kitchen in Hong Kong so as to further improve standardisation and efficiency in its food processing. The Group will also further expand the service coverage of “Tsui Wah Delivery”. As regards the Group’s information management system, the Group will strengthen its management efficiency and cost controls by implementing an ERP system. In addition, the Group has also strived to expand its “Supreme Catering” service to meet the increasing demand in Hong Kong for catering events. With the new central kitchen designated for “Supreme Catering” in Yau Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong which will come into operation by mid-July 2014, the Group can provide a comprehensive range of catering services with tailor-made menus for its customers. In the PRC market, the Group is expected to continue to benefit from (i) the ongoing urbanisation in the PRC; (ii) the rising disposable income of the country’s burgeoning middle class; and (iii) an increase in awareness and market demand for quality dining at a reasonable cost. The Group will continue to valuate expansion possibilities in different provinces in China. In addition, while focusing on providing better food and service quality, the Group will also strengthen its operational systems by retaining experienced staff and encouraging creative product development. All these, along with enhanced marketing and brand recognition activities, will ensure the Group’s ability in generating revenue and maximising the returns to its Shareholders. In view of the conditions outlined above, the Board believes that “Tsui Wah” has the resources, vision and reputation to capitalise on future opportunities for continued expansion in the enormous PRC market as well as in Hong Kong.

Distribution and marketing expenses increased to HK$25,854,583 (2013: HK$21,537,667) representing an increase of 20.0% compared with last year.

Finance costs amounting to HK$30,261,587 (2013: HK$36,800,952) represented a decrease of 17.8% compared with last year, which was mainly due to the reduced borrowing level. The over-provision for the year ended 31 March 2013 included an amount of HK$15,800,000 related to a case settled with the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (the “IRD”) during the year ended 31 March 2013. In previous year, the IRD questioned the basis of tax reporting for certain transactions adopted by certain subsidiaries of the Group. Current income tax in relation to the issue of approximately HK$20,500,000 was provided for and recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008, whilst deferred income tax liabilities in relation to these transactions of approximately HK$6,800,000 was provided in prior years. During the year ended 31 March 2013, the case was resolved with the IRD. Reversal of current income tax of approximately HK$15,800,000 and write-back of deferred income tax liabilities of approximately HK$6,800,000 was recorded in the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2013. The write-back of deferred income tax liabilities was included in the origination and reversal of deferred income tax of HK$5,137,639 for the year ended 31 March 2013. Pursuant to the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared to foreign investors from the foreign investment enterprises established in Mainland China. The requirement is effective from 1 January 2008 and applies to earnings after 31 December 2007. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign investors. As at 31 March 2013, the undistributed profits of the relevant subsidiary of the Group in the PRC were HK$185,454,883 and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities had not been recognised as the Company was able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it was probable that the temporary difference would not reverse in the foreseeable future. As a result of the change of management intentions during the year, the undistributed profits of the relevant subsidiary of approximately HK$239,549,000 as at 31 March 2014 will be remitted outside China in future. Deferred income tax liabilities of approximately HK$13,119,000 have been provided for in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014.

During the year, the Group recognised a fair value loss on embedded derivative of the convertible redeemable bond amounting to HK$166,724,000 (2013: realised loss and loss from change in fair value of embedded derivative of the convertible redeemable bond amounting to HK$173,731,960), which is primarily a result of the changes of certain parameters during the year used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives including but not limited to the Company’s share price and its volatility, interest rates and the likelihood of the exercise of the conversion right and redemption rights of the convertible redeemable bond by the bondholder and the Company, respectively.

In 2015, the Group entered into the financial and insurance brokerage industries by way of acquisition of the entire issued capital of Kirin Financial Group Limited (“KFG”) and Kirin Finance Limited (“Kirin Finance”) which are principally engaged in insurance brokerage and money lending business respectively in Hong Kong. The Directors consider that the transformation can generate long-term return to the Group and shareholders. Kirin Wealth Management Limited (“KWM”), a subsidiary of KFG which is principally engaged in the provision of insurance brokerage services. KWM holds a license issued by Professional Insurance Brokers Association (“PIBA”). There are 38 back-office staff members and 60 consultants in the insurance brokerage and related services (the “Insurance Brokerage Business”). The diagram below demonstrates the business model of the Insurance Brokerage Business: The Group had built up a network with not less than 30 products issuers. Major product issuers of the Insurance Brokerage Business are local branches of nationwide insurance companies. The commission income paid by the major product issuers to the Group accounted for approximately 39%, 68%, 64% and 76% of the Group’s revenue for the four financial years ended 30 June 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. There are 60 consultants who are capable for providing insurance advisory services and financial needs analysis to the clients (the “Consultants”).

After-sale services are performed by the Consultants and the client servicing department of the Group to handle the clients’ enquiries or complaints through telephone calls or e-mails. In the mid-2018, the Group built and installed our own after-sales service platform – customer relationship management system (the “CRM system”).

The revenue has significantly increased 55% compared to previous year as the Directors considered that (i) the business strategy on marketing and promotion conducted previously has taken a positive effect during the year ended 30 June 2019; and (ii) more attractive rates were offered to the insurance brokers. In the near future, we plan to further implement different strategies to strengthen the brand recognition and revenue stream of the Insurance Brokerage Business. To achieve our goals, we have established a professional and experienced management team to guide and manage the Consultants team. Moreover, a training department has established to provide regular training courses to the Consultants and they must participant in the courses arranged by us. Every quarter we will provide an in-house CPD course for the Consultants, which takes 2 – 3 hours of each course. The Consultants will further enhance their technology capabilities through our regular training course.

With the help of the multi-dimensional advertisements and promotions implemented from time to time, the Group will be benefited from having more market shares, expanding its customer base, building up reputation and goodwill in Hong Kong and Southern China. The brand of “Kirin Group” becomes more and more well-known and trustworthy. It is not only benefit to the Insurance Brokerage Business but also the Money Lending Business. Most importantly, the revenue of the Group is in an upward trend. In the future, the Group will continue to put efforts on marketing and may expand the brand building activities and business development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Company conducts its money lending business in Hong Kong (“Money Lending Business”) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, i.e. Kirin Finance. The Money Lending Business is principally engaged in the provision of personal loans to individual clients without securities. The Money Lenders Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong) and the Money Lenders Regulations (Chapter 163A of the Laws of Hong Kong) (the “Statutes”) are the principal laws governing money lending business in Hong Kong. The Statutes stipulate that no person shall carry on business as a money lender without a licence under the Money Lenders Ordinance (“Money Lenders Licence”). Kirin Finance commenced its money lending business in 2015 after obtaining its Money Lenders Licence and has been operating as a licensed money lender since then. Kirin Finance provides clients with term loans for periods up to 18 months. Kirin Finance enters into loan agreement with its clients, which sets out, amongst others, date of the agreement, the parties, principal amount, interest rates, maturity date and events of default. Upon maturity, the loan may be renewed after assessment on the client’s ability to repay, funds on hand of Kirin Finance and the prevailing market sentiment. During the year ended 30 June 2019, the Money Lending Business recorded revenue of approximately HK$18,412,000 which represents an increase of approximately 3% as compared to previous year (2018: approximately HK$17,855,000). Business Model Kirin Finance generates revenue from interest received from the provision of personal loans to its individual clients with or without collateral or securities. The Money Lending Business has rigorous assessment procedure on each loan application. Background check and credit assessment will be performed on the client by staff of financing department before granting the loan. Kirin Finance will only grant loans when it is satisfied with the recoverability of the loan after considering the financial strength and credibility of the client as well as the amount of loan to be granted. Kirin Finance does not advertise the Money Lending Business in public media. Instead, clients are referred by the Insurance Brokerage Business, whilst the Loan Review & Approval Department is responsible for processing loan applications and managing credit exposure of Kirin Finance. The Directors believe that by the close interaction between different departments, Kirin Finance is able to process and grant loans to suitable clients in an expedited manner with competitive lending rates. Before granting loans to any client, credit assessment for loan applicants must be completed. In assessing creditworthiness, Kirin Finance focuses primarily on the applicant’s financial background, occupation, credit history, repayment history for returning clients, which help Kirin Finance to assess the client’s repayment ability. Kirin Finance may also obtain credit history of loan applicants by credit search with external credit reporting agencies. Since loans to be granted by Kirin Finance are unsecured in nature and impose higher credit risk on the Group, Kirin Finance will approve such loan only in circumstances where it is satisfied with the recoverability of the loan after considering the financial strength and credibility of the client as well as the amount of loan to be granted. Before signing the loan agreement with the client, besides going through the terms in the loan agreement, staff of Kirin Finance will also draw client’s attention to Part III and Part IV of the Money Lenders Ordinance, which relate to, amongst others, duty of money lender to give information to borrower, early payment by borrower and prohibition of excessive interest rates. Kirin Finance approves credit line for each loan applicant on a case-by-case basis, which is largely up to its credit assessment results as well as the prevailing market conditions. Credit line stands for the maximum amount of loan which is allowed for a client in one lump sum or in installments. The higher the credit line, the more stringent will the approval process be. Before granting any loan to loan applicants, size tests calculation will be performed by the financial controller of the Company. Announcement will be made by the Company in accordance with GEM Listing Rules as and when appropriate. The Loan Review & Approval Department will conduct review on each outstanding loan every year. If any material deterioration in the client’s financial position is identified, Kirin Finance may demand for immediate repayment. Kirin Finance will first negotiate with the client on repayment of the loan, if failed, legal proceedings against such client will be the last resort. The amount of loans granted in Hong Kong by all authorised institutions showed a moderate increase during the last couple of years. Besides banks and financial institutions, there are lots of licensed money lenders in Hong Kong, including Kirin Finance, which grant loans to loan applicants. The Directors consider the industry entry barrier to be limited for the Money Lending Business in view of the lack of regulator. It is difficult for Kirin Finance to stand out among its competitors considering the keen competition brought by the large number of industry participants. Accordingly, the Company does not plan to devote its greatest resources to strengthen the marketing and promotion of the brand image of Kirin Finance as it will incur a very high marketing cost for the Group. Instead, Kirin Finance will (i) enhance its service to cater for clients’ specific borrowing needs; (ii) continue to build up its reputation as a reliable and professional money lender in Hong Kong; and (iii) provide aggressive interest rates to attract more new clients. Kirin Finance may also consider granting loans with collaterals to mitigate and control its credit risks. In view of the expected fluctuations in China and global market, the Company will maintain the status quo of the Money Lending Business and adopt a more cautious and prudent approach before granting loans to potential clients. Sang Woo (Kirin) Securities Limited (“Kirin Securities”), a subsidiary of the Company, holds licenses to carry out type 1 and type 4 regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Chapter 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong). This subsidiary provides securities brokerage services by acting as placing agent and joint lead manager for clients in the securities related business.

The placing service primarily generate fee and commission from equity and bond placing. The placing commission charged by Kirin Securities is subject to negotiation and is generally in line with market practice. The Group had a plan to start securities business in 2016. In May 2017, the licenses of Kirin Securities were granted by the SFC and the Group has well equipped its trading system in 2018 and started to provide trading services to the clients. In a prudent manner, the Group does not provide margin financing for the time being. Having broad connection and rich experiences of the existing management, Kirin Securities started to act as a joint lead manager for an initial public offering (“IPO”) for the first time. The commission of the IPO is 8%, which brings approximately HK$4,200,000 revenue to Kirin Securities during the year ended 30 June 2019. This transaction initiates a good start in the securities related business. Besides the factors disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report (i.e. uncertain political conditions and change in government policy in the Philippines), the Company decided to dispose of the subsidiary engaging in the IT Business so as to streamline its business segments. On 27 December 2018, the company announced a disclosable transaction in relation to the disposal of interest in Red Rabbit International Technology, Inc. and it was completed on 31 December 2018. The Company intends to devote its resources to other business sector to find more investment opportunities with better return for its shareholders. The Company has strived hard to expand and develop the livestock business. However, since the outbreak of African swine fever, it has hit farms and the whole industry of livestock in Mainland China. Therefore, the livestock business has generated minimal revenue in 2018. In view of the outlook for the livestock industry being uncertain, the Company decided to gradually scale down the livestock business. During the year ended 30 June 2019, the livestock business did not record any revenue. As such, a scale down of the livestock business would only bring minimal impact to the Group. Subsequent to 30 June 2019, the Group has disposed of the livestock business. Details are set out in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements – Events after the reporting period.
